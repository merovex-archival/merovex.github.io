Some of my fellow authors have chaffed at the recent Amazon innovation of the KU/KOLL. Perhaps my sales aren't a bit enough deal, but I find that I have done better under this model.

<!-- more -->

Let's first get it out in the open. In 2015, I sold over 1600 units. In 2015, I sold 171. These are Kindle Books alone. So, I am not a major blockbuster author. My total earnings over the past two years has been around $1200, which is under break-even because of my engaging an editor.

My KU/KOLL in 2015 was 76 units, bringing my total Kindle and KU/KOLL to 247. Thirty percent of my 2015 sales were from KU/KOLL. Without getting into all of the details, I earned more from that 30 percent since I sell Kindle books at $0.35.

As you can tell, I also failed to deliver on my 2015 goal of publishing the next two books in the series.
