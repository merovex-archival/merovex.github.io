All the concrete representations of that deliberative crafting are an author's work product: character sketches, story outlines, early drafts. You need to demonstrate this in evidence.

**Poor Man's Copyright?** I addressed this in 2010, but the PMC is a [well-debunked urban legend](http://newyorkcopyrightattorney.com/poor-mans-copyright/). Moving on.

Next time, I'll offer how we as authors should respond to the legal landscape that expects that we be ready to defend our copyright.

In the first article, I provided a [copyright overview](/writing/copyright-overview/) that states that "Registered or not, an Author has a responsibility to ensure they can prove their authorship of a work." In the second article, I discuss what [copyright means in the 9th Circuit](/writing/copyright-overview/) as it pertains to proving authorship. In this article, I share how I think we as authors should respond to this legal landscape.

<!-- more -->

We've already discussed that copyright law expects us to protect and defend our work. The 9th Circuit explains that the validity of our authorship is ultimately a question for a jury, that a registered work provides a rebuttable presumption of authorship. In its jury questions, it instructs the jury to consider the originality of the work (non-derivative and creative) and a mastermind role in creation of the work.

**Definition: Author's Work Product.** Work product in business or layman's terms indicates the final product. In the legal domain, "[work product](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Attorney_work_product)" are the correspondance between client and attorney and the materials the attorney uses in preparation of litigation. Unlike attorney-client privilege, this extends to materials and documents.
I'm co-opting that term to describe an author's work product as "materials an author uses in preparation and development of a final product that show ."

What is an author's work product? Included in this would be the following:

* Character sketches
* Story outlines
* Scene summaries
* Research notes
* Earlier drafts
* Electronic correspondance with editors, beta readers, etc. (FB, Twitter, email)



As an author, you should always be in a better position to demonstrate an author's work product than the infringer. If you had to stack your work product against another's, would it show how you developed an idea and crafted a work? Of course, you should. You've put work into it and the infringer had not.

## Technology: Friend and Foe; Or How Scrivener Helps

Historically, an author's work product comprised wood pulp and ink. It was physical, likely put in a box and ignored on a shelf once the book were complete. In 1976, books were still printed on presses using letter molds, though the technology had improved dramatically. But, when I wrote my papers in law school, I kept record of all the research and notes on whatever I wrote about. I still have research on two of those papers in storage.

Now, books are largely the result of a computer printer. The work product is likely also electronic. It is stored on thumb drives, hard drives, or perhaps a cloud storage provider such as Dropbox or Google Docs. Maybe you use Evernote for your novel or series bible, storing the character sketches, etc. Or, you're using Scrivener for everything.

The risk, I think, is that with electronic storage you are less likely able to show evolution. You would be wise to periodically store off complete snapshots of your work, which is possible with Scrivener's backups where you frequently preserve a full backup. While with the Poor Man's Copyright there's a possibility of fraud, having dozens of archived, evolutionary copies of your work is harder to pull off as a fraud.

Git can also help in this regard. As [Jamie Rubin's recent article about GitHub](http://www.jamierubin.net/2015/12/22/tracking-the-things-i-make-with-github/) suggests, you can backup Scrivener using GitHub, BitBucket or the like. Assuming you committed frequently (via automatic push?), then the degree of evolution offered is striking. The key is to reduce the likelihood of infringement by keeping any git repository private.

## State of Things Since 2010

*Scintilla* was originally written in Scrivener, and was published in 2011. I did some work on *Bellicose* in 2012. I hit some roadblocks, fretted and fumed and blamed the tool instead of the craftsman.

In January 2013, I started using git to store the Postal Marine Series novel; using my own [Bookmaker toolchain](/technology/toolchain/), derived from [Kitabu](https://github.com/fnando/kitabu) (see the [Gem history](https://rubygems.org/gems/bookmaker/versions). The git repository for the novel series had 329 commits from January 2013 until November 2014. Then I changed to individual repositories for each novel.

In January 2015, I registered copyrights for my published works and have since had the certificates issued.

The September Scrivener update and [Jamie Rubin's recent article about GitHub](http://www.jamierubin.net/2015/12/22/tracking-the-things-i-make-with-github/) inspired me to give Scrivener another try. As such, I've ported my WIP and previously published works in the Postal Marine Series into Scrivener and committed that Scrivener to GitHub.

The big update here is that for the past three years I've used git repositories to track the evolutionary development of my works prior to copyright registration. Any work before that date of note was either ported into git, or registered. Jamie's article helped me realize I can continue to use git while using Scrivener. Why I had that mental blog befuddles me, but it was there.

What does 2016 hold? Scrivener in Git. I will try to post some on this in the coming year in my Technology thread.

## How Could Scrivener Help?

In 2010, I mention the value of showing evolutionary improvement. Traditionally this would work by having past copies of printed manuscripts and revisions. The author's file box. That's what Scrivener is today.

One of Scrivener's strengths is its ability to centralize all of an authors deliberative materials. Those character sketches, scene designs, background research, etc., can all be stored there. By combining that centralized storage with a third-party versioning tool like Git (on GitHub, BitBucket or other), the author is in a better position to provide evidence during a suit.

Will it be enough? Maybe. Consult with an attorney to have a better idea. As I said in 2010, we authors sometimes worry too much about our stories.

This is my approach as much because it also helps me avoid losing information to a computer death. My primary reason for using git is to offset the risk of losing countless hours of work.
