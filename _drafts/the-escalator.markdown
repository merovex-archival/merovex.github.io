As a lark, I'm trying the Coursera course on plotting. The first week's assignment is entitled "The Escalator." The premise of the assignment is to create a character with three wants, draft a 250-word story plot involving that character and as many of a list of 12 words as you can.

## Story

Kurt Eras watched the shoreline from *aboard* his yacht.
The SS *Tiger* was his chance to fight his battle with the belly.
On cue, his stomach growled.
Satisfied he was alone, he headed to the galley, where his favorite *appliance* was.
The timer showed a few minutes to go before his dessert was ready.
He heared his pet *crow* cawing--the animal wanted his meal.
Kurt headed forward, hoping he would not need clean the *cage*. 
He grabbed a box of dessicated mice to feed the beast.

Kurt arrived to a *filthy* room caused by the crow flinging cage contents across the cabin.
He wanted to fling the cage out into the ocean, but stopped himself, the crow belonged to his beloved mother. The *memory* of her care for him through the years checked his anger.

As he cleaned the cabin, his dessert's smell--*carrot* cake--wafted in.
He could not hear the oven timer's *rings* that far forward.
The fragrant aroma of carrot cake gave way to the burnt smell he loathed. He dropped the broom and ran back to the galley.
He watched as the cake *exploded* in the oven.

He shook with rage. It was is last desert.

Once he calmed down, he decided to smear some of the icing on one of the dessicated mice to *trick* his mind into thinking it was carrot cake. The taste was awful. However much he tried to pretend, he could not get over the flavor, so he hurled it from the yacht.
