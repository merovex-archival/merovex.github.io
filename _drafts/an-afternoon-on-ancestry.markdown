How often have you been told you were related to Napoleon? Or that all of our ancestors were involved in the same great battle of the middle ages? I decided to burn a few dollars and run the gauntlet on Ancestry.com.

There were two great questions that I've always had. First, I was told that my ancestors have been on the continent almost as soon as the English landed. I was also told that I was part Indian (as in indigenous, or first nation). So, what of it? Finally, I was told my grandfather's grandfather fled Scotland with his brother from a wedding "not of his choosing."

### Wilsons

I followed the Wilson thread back. The Wilson name that I bear arrived in the 1880s. The line to be English, not Scottish, but being a Scot was a huge deal of my grandfather's it is possible that these were Scots living in England.

I can only trace my father's mother's line back to the mid-1840s in Kentucky (the Partains). Though the Blackwells (wife of the first Partain) we encounter Captain Thomas Blackwell (1752 Fauquir Cty, VA - 1831 Kentucky), his father (also a Captain 1713 - 1772), Judge Samuel Blackwell (1680 - 1732) in Northumberland, VA and their ancestor Joseph Blackwell (Glouchester England, 1610 - 1865 VA) who married Margaret Downmam (1645 - 1686, Lancaster VA)

### Lowes

However, my grandfather's mother belongs to the Loe (or Lowe or Low) branch. That name traces back to 1642 when the second son was born to Thomas Loe who immigrated with his wife from Canterbury, England. The older son was born in 1640. When looking at the [Wikipedia article on Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Virginia#Royal_colony) at the time, women were brought to Virginia first in 1619. It became a royal colony in 1624. The [Third Anglo-Powhatan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Powhatan_Wars) ran from 1644-46, and the English Civil War was not far behind. Amazing to consider that I had ancestors here during that tumultuous time.

### Eltons & Mitchells

My mother's line is largely Irish, with a bit of English and Indigenous. The family on that side is huge, with lots of children each generation. It appears I have a relative who died during the trail of tears. 

* Robert Mitchell - Ireland, 1662. His grandson Adam (Pennsylvania, 1745) fights for American Independence (DAR: 456,478).
* Rev. Samuel Doak, II - Ireland, 1716. His granddaughter Nancy Doak (Tennessee, 1790) marries Robert's grandson William Mitchell. His son is Rev. [Samuel Doak, III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Doak) (1749 - 1830) who was a pioneer in the slavery abolition movement and friend of Robert Alexander who founded Washington and Lee.
* Michael Pendergrass(t) - Ireland, 1664. He marries Rebecca LNU (Ireland, 1664) and drags her to [Cumberland County Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_County,_Virginia) by 1687. He is accompanied by his father and grandfather from [County Mayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Mayo#17th_and_18th_centuries).
* Sounehooway Toontroontora Thomas Splitlog (born 1755, [Shawnee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee)) married Vocemassussia Isabella Shawnee (born circa 1760 - 1815, Shawnee) - Indigenous. Their daughter Agnes Jaweccer Splitlog (Georgia, 1778) marries James Mormon (England, 1776) in 1801 and dies (Alabama, 1838) during the last force migration of the Trail of Tears era, as did her father Thomas Splitlog (in Georgia). It appears they lived near Virginia beach shortly before their death.
* Mormon's line merges with the Pendergrass line when Willie Mormon marries John Pendergrast by 1887.
* William Elton (County Down Ireland, 1735 - Washington County, GA, 1826) and his son Abraham (CD Ireland, 1750 - [Sandersville, GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandersville,_Georgia) 1826) move to Georgia by 1785. Their son Abraham migrates to Snyder, Arkansas by 1862 where the Eltons where ultimately my grandfather was born.
