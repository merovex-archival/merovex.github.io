How often have you been told you were related to Napoleon? Or that all of our ancestors were involved in the same great battle of the middle ages? I decided to burn a few dollars and run the gauntlet on Ancestry.com.

There were two great questions that I've always had. First, I was told that my ancestors have been on the continent almost as soon as the English landed. I was also told that I was part Indian (as in indigenous, or first nation). So, what of it? Finally, I was told my grandfather's grandfather fled Scotland with his brother from a wedding "not of his choosing."

I followed the Wilson thread back. The Wilson name that I bear arrived in the 1880s belonging to . Looks to be English, not Scottish, but being a Scot was a huge deal of my grandfather's.

However, my grandfather's mother belongs to the Loe (or Lowe or Low) branch. That name traces back to 1642 when the second son was born to Thomas Loe who immigrated with his wife from Canterbury, England. The older son was born in 1640. When looking at the [Wikipedia article on Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Virginia#Royal_colony) at the time, women were brought to Virginia first in 1619. It became a royal colony in 1624. The [Third Anglo-Powhatan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Powhatan_Wars) ran from 1644-46, and the English Civil War was not far behind.

Maternal Grandmother's line is largely Irish, with a bit of English and Indigenous:

* Robert Mitchell - Ireland, 1662. His grandson Adam (Pennsylvania, 1745) fights for American Independence (DAR: 456,478).
* Rev. Samuel Doak, II - Ireland, 1716. His granddaughter Nancy Doak (Tennessee, 1790) marries Robert's grandson William Mitchell.
* Sounehooway Toontroontora Thomas Splitlog (born 1755) Vocemassussia Isabella Shawnee (born circa 1760) - Indigenous. Their daughter Agnes Splitlog (1778) marries James Mormon (England, 1776) in 1801 and dies (Alabama, 1838) during the last force migration of the Trail of Tears era. Mormon's line merges with the Pendergrass line.
* Michael Pendergrass(t) - Ireland, 1664. He marries Rebecca LNU (Ireland, 1664) and drags her to Virginia.

Paternal Grandmother's line

* Joseph Blackwell - England, 1610.
