Above the fold

<!-- more -->

First of all, tell me a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.



What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without?



What’s your workspace setup like?


What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?


What’s your favorite to-do list manager?


Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can’t you live without and why?


What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret?


What do you listen to while you work? Got a favorite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence?


What are you currently reading? A novel, comic book, website, magazine? Or what’s something you’d recommend?


How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work?



What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser?



Fill in the blank: I’d love to see _________ answer these same questions.



What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?
