Not exactly what you might expect, but I thought about starting a series on book summaries. I listen to a lot of audio books due to how busy I make myself. But, there are some books that are worth sitting down and reading. *Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?* seemed like as good a place to start the series as any.

*Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord* is subtitled "A biblical theology of the book of Leviticus." As a Protestant, Leviticus is one of the last books I would consider doing a long crawl through for understanding. But, L. the Michael Morales presents a compelling case to lead me to want to summarize it. *Who Shall Ascend?* is one of a series of works in the "New Studies in Biblical Theology" series.
