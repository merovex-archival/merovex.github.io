## Overview

I've owned two Beetles in my past, a 1971 Super (in Germany), and a 1969 standard. I gave away the '69 in 1999, and missed it ever since. I saw a '72 for sale in my neighborhood, and my wife approved the project. I thought it would need a little rust TLC, but the more I dug into it, the more I realized how much was involved. Call it mid-life crisis, but I endeavor to do the repair.

I realize that a Beetle restoration more like a full-scale model building activity.

This page is my attempt to summarize everything I'm doing in this project. Maybe somebody else will be motivated to follow my path.
