## Chapter Summaries

1. Christ demonstrated a life of discipline much like a pro athlete. His behaviors, death and resurrection testify to the power of that discipline. We Christians miss this easy yoke because as humans we seek the reward of pro-behavior in crises without the toil necessary to achieve it. We must recognize this and resolve to follow the example of how he lived.
2. The Modern Christian era suffers from generations of poor church leadership, the empty promises of Liberal, Conservative and Evangelical Christianity, and the shallow pool offered by current church disciplines (attendance, tithing, study, prayer and service). Valid spiritual disciplines involve activities affecting normal, everyday living, be grounded in Scripture, and be in the service of ordinary Christians

### Chapter 1: Secret of the Easy Yoke

1. "Christianity has not so much been tried and found wanting, as it has been found difficult and left untried." The life of the transgressor is hard (Pv 13:15)
2. Christians find the effort of following Christ difficult and demoralizing, leading us to conclude that His expectations are idealized.
3. The Pro Baseball player analogy: Kids think if they have the same kit as their hero, they can be experts like him. They fail to notice the sweat equity invested over the years to get there.
4. A successful performance during crisis relies upon rigorous preparation using the whole person. "[Plato said, there is an art of living and the living is only excellent when the self is prepared in all the depths & dimensions of its being."
5. Our bias causes us to miss that Jesus recognized the need for whole-person preparation, that his life is an exemplar for how we should/could actually live ours. His death & resurrection merely point to his life-example being correct. **We need to see the secret involves living as he lived in the entirety of his life--adopt his overall life style.**
6. "The general human failing  is to want what is right and important, but at the same time not commit to the kind of life that will produce the action we know to be right and the condition we want to enjoy."
7. Our effort to avoid the necessary pain of discipline means we miss the easy yoke and light burden. We cannot behave on-the-spot like Christ did and taught and simultaneously live as everybody else does.
8. When we live a life as he did and taught, the behaviors he described (walking the 2nd mile) will seem the only proper and natural thing to do.
9. "The secret of the easy yoke...is to learn from Christ how to live our total lives, how to invest all our time and our energies of mind and body as he did."
10. "The secret of the easy yoke is simple...it is the intelligent, informed, unyielding resolve to live as Jesus lived in all aspects of his life, not just in the moment of specific choice or action."

### Chapter 2: Making Theology of the Disciplines Practical

11. "Thus men will lie on their backs, talking about the fall of man, and never make an effort to get up." Thoreau. What does it mean to commit sin?
12. We feel the need to live with the dichotomy between our conscience and how we live our lives, that we cannot live the life Christ expects of us.
13. Realize that you are either intending to serve him, or intending *not* to serve him. We can resolve this dilemma when we have a realistic plan for how to be like Christ.
14. Practical theology is something everybody has...it is a way of thinking about and understanding God.
15. Practical theology is made more difficult because during periods of church history leaders have lacked the wisdom and power to equip saints, nor do they see the serious need to do so immediately.
16. Challenge your elder by asking, "what is the church's plan for teaching our people to do everything God commanded?" The truth is, we lack a *plan*. Instead, we are hobbled by the modern scientific, technical and anti-religious movements.
17. Richard Foster's *Celebration of Discipline* (1978) reflects a current to get back to essentials, but otherwise there is insufficient writing to support (circa 1999).
18. What our elders teach is not advancing us spiritually. The members are eager, but  there is a theological deficiency, a lack in teaching, understanding and practical direction due to the current methods of ministry and teaching (attendance, tithing, prayer, reading, service and witness).
19. By contrast, the traditional disciplines respect and count on the bodily nature of human personality and involve bodily conditions and activities that leads to the "Living Sacrifices" of Romans 12:1.
20. The introduction of modern counseling in churches has led to the same demoralization as not taking on the yoke. "Spritual growth and vitality stem from what we actually *do* with our lives, from the *habits* we form, and from the *character* that results." While God's grace saves us, it is our continual action that makes us a different kind of person.
21. Modern trends in Protestant faiths is to look beyond the differences of the denominations, but this has also dulled the specific character of church life.
22. Both Conservative and Liberal Christianity have depleted their promises
23. This is due to the mental view of faith that leaves the Bible to no longer being functionally authoritative over life. This is demonstrated by the "lack of saltiness" in American society despite the alleged conversion experience.
24. Modern Christianity fails because it is too shallow. The Disciplines, by contrast offer the promise of making our lives a form that would serve as a receptacle for the substance of Christ-life in God's (present) Kingdom.
25. All that said, we need to ensure that the disciplines are authentic and Scripturally founded. We need a "theology of the disciplines for the spiritual life."
26. Any informed theology must be in the service of ordinary Christians living ordinary lives for it to have a right proper benefit. Foster's *Celebrating the Disciplines* is a practical guide that Willard's *Spirit of the Disciplines* is not.
