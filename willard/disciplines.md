## Chapter Summaries

1. Christ demonstrated a life of discipline much like a pro athlete. His behaviors, death and resurrection testify to the power of that discipline. We Christians miss this easy yoke because as humans we seek the reward of pro-behavior in crises without the toil necessary to achieve it. We must recognize this and resolve to follow the example of how he lived.
2. The Modern Christian era suffers from generations of poor church leadership, the empty promises of Liberal, Conservative and Evangelical Christianity, and the shallow pool offered by current church disciplines (attendance, tithing, study, prayer and service). Valid spiritual disciplines involve activities affecting normal, everyday living, be grounded in Scripture, and be in the service of ordinary Christians.
3. Modern Christianity assumes a dichotomy in spiritual and non-spiritual life, and in the body and mind/spirit that is not present in the Bible. This leads to powerlessness, and ultimately to cheap counterfeits of Christianity. Instead, faith is both a mental and physical action that leads to our transformation and power in this present world and birth in God's present Kingdom. The body is corrupted by our fall, but like the rest of creation it was intended for far nobler uses.
4. We are here to govern Creation as God does: in peace, understanding, love and harmony. Efforts to nurture nature reflect that calling, while our inability to harmonize with nature (wolf & monk) reveals we live in the ruins of our making. We are less than God because we are expected to rely on his power, yet he gave us a measure of independence...we are not puppets.

### Chapter 1: Secret of the Easy Yoke

1. "Christianity has not so much been tried and found wanting, as it has been found difficult and left untried." The life of the transgressor is hard (Pv 13:15)
2. Christians find the effort of following Christ difficult and demoralizing, leading us to conclude that His expectations are idealized.
3. The Pro Baseball player analogy: Kids think if they have the same kit as their hero, they can be experts like him. They fail to notice the sweat equity invested over the years to get there.
4. A successful performance during crisis relies upon rigorous preparation using the whole person. "[Plato said, there is an art of living and the living is only excellent when the self is prepared in all the depths & dimensions of its being."
5. Our bias causes us to miss that Jesus recognized the need for whole-person preparation, that his life is an exemplar for how we should/could actually live ours. His death & resurrection merely point to his life-example being correct. **We need to see the secret involves living as he lived in the entirety of his life--adopt his overall life style.**
6. "The general human failing  is to want what is right and important, but at the same time not commit to the kind of life that will produce the action we know to be right and the condition we want to enjoy."
7. Our effort to avoid the necessary pain of discipline means we miss the easy yoke and light burden. We cannot behave on-the-spot like Christ did and taught and simultaneously live as everybody else does.
8. When we live a life as he did and taught, the behaviors he described (walking the 2nd mile) will seem the only proper and natural thing to do.
9. "The secret of the easy yoke...is to learn from Christ how to live our total lives, how to invest all our time and our energies of mind and body as he did."
10. "The secret of the easy yoke is simple...it is the intelligent, informed, unyielding resolve to live as Jesus lived in all aspects of his life, not just in the moment of specific choice or action."

### Chapter 2: Making Theology of the Disciplines Practical

11. "Thus men will lie on their backs, talking about the fall of man, and never make an effort to get up." Thoreau. What does it mean to commit sin?
12. We feel the need to live with the dichotomy between our conscience and how we live our lives, that we cannot live the life Christ expects of us.
13. Realize that you are either intending to serve him, or intending *not* to serve him. We can resolve this dilemma when we have a realistic plan for how to be like Christ.
14. Practical theology is something everybody has...it is a way of thinking about and understanding God.
15. Practical theology is made more difficult because during periods of church history leaders have lacked the wisdom and power to equip saints, nor do they see the serious need to do so immediately.
16. Challenge your elder by asking, "what is the church's plan for teaching our people to do everything God commanded?" The truth is, we lack a *plan*. Instead, we are hobbled by the modern scientific, technical and anti-religious movements.
17. Richard Foster's *Celebration of Discipline* (1978) reflects a current to get back to essentials, but otherwise there is insufficient writing to support (circa 1999).
18. What our elders teach is not advancing us spiritually. The members are eager, but  there is a theological deficiency, a lack in teaching, understanding and practical direction due to the current methods of ministry and teaching (attendance, tithing, prayer, reading, service and witness).
19. By contrast, the traditional disciplines respect and count on the bodily nature of human personality and involve bodily conditions and activities that leads to the "Living Sacrifices" of Romans 12:1.
20. The introduction of modern counseling in churches has led to the same demoralization as not taking on the yoke. "Spritual growth and vitality stem from what we actually *do* with our lives, from the *habits* we form, and from the *character* that results." While God's grace saves us, it is our continual action that makes us a different kind of person.
21. Modern trends in Protestant faiths is to look beyond the differences of the denominations, but this has also dulled the specific character of church life.
22. Both Conservative and Liberal Christianity have depleted their promises
23. This is due to the mental view of faith that leaves the Bible to no longer being functionally authoritative over life. This is demonstrated by the "lack of saltiness" in American society despite the alleged conversion experience.
24. Modern Christianity fails because it is too shallow. The Disciplines, by contrast offer the promise of making our lives a form that would serve as a receptacle for the substance of Christ-life in God's (present) Kingdom.
25. All that said, we need to ensure that the disciplines are authentic and Scripturally founded. We need a "theology of the disciplines for the spiritual life."
26. Any informed theology must be in the service of ordinary Christians living ordinary lives for it to have a right proper benefit. Foster's *Celebrating the Disciplines* is a practical guide that Willard's *Spirit of the Disciplines* is not.

### Chapter 3: Salvation is a Life

28. Modern Christians tend to not recognize that our spiritual life is not separate from our regular life.
29. The connection between the disciplines and the easy yoke rests upon human nature; even Jesus had to learn obedience (Heb 5:8). The human body is the focal point of human existence, even for Jesus.
30. The root cause of this spirit/physical separate mindset stems from the notion, on some level, that Jesus did not truly have a physical body. Like the Gnostics of the late First Century AD. But Christ's birth, life, death and resurrection were all bodily.
31. Salvation, therefore, affects our bodies, too. We cannot therefore exclude our bodies from our religion.
32. Because modern Christians exclude the body, they find themselves powerless. The division between denominations is less significant than the division between the body and spirit in our daily walk.
33. We need to radicalize our concept of salvation as the Modern Christian concept is limited to "theories of atonement," and are therefore shallow.
34. This Atonement focus of salvation is a recent development in Christian History.
35. Christ's life was what gave the early church the courage to remain steadfast as they were persecuted and killed.
36. When we shifted the focus from the redemptive value of his life to the redemptive value of his death, we handicapped our Christian walk.
37. Jesus message was on newness of life, and his resurrection validated the reality and indestructibility of his message and example. You are saved so you have Life.
38. *Redemption as impartation of life.* A new life means new behaviors, not because they are mandated, but because they are natural...like mosquitoes who go from the pond to the air. A holy life is what we are reborn to live.
39. There is a worldliness that seeks to be the cheapest counterfeit of Christianity, contrasted with a faith that by its existence must move and have power and life...a powerful life force.
40. This exists in three dimensions to the extent of translating us into the Kingdom of God as his children:
    1. New power within the individual, an new leaf shooting through and dispelling the old
    2. Transformation of character and personality
    3. Extrahuman powers over the evils of this present world
41. Rather than an inward mental action alone, faith is a bodily action as well where the body is surrendered in precise ways and definite actions to God. Thus, the body can be a positive action.
42. While there are places in the Bible that describe the vileness of the body, the result of a fallen world, "[T]he human body was made to be the vehicle of human personality ruling the earth for God and through his power."

### Chapter 4: Little Less than God

* Ruins of Our Making
* Dust & Divinity

44. The inability to explain "why are we here" is the biggest problem in humanity, are we meant to do more than just survive? Yet, our salvation depends on an ability to answer this question.
45. Because where we live are the ruins of where what we were intended for, mere observation cannot yield the proper answer; leaving secular efforts to ultimate futility.
46. The distance between our aspirations and our reality is a shadow of what we were intended for, and that distance is such that our possibilities leads us to heaven or hell.
47. The fact that God engages with us speaks to our greater intent.
48. The monk and the wolf story reminds us that our purpose was to govern the earth
49. Our creation was distinct from God's creation of all other things, we know this from how he fashioned us, breathed life into us, and purposed us.
50. God demonstrated governance by speaking, by use of harmony and understanding. "When the work of the best rulers is done, their task accomplished, the people all remark, 'We have done it ourselves.'"
51. We have various urges regarding Creation that are a pale shadow of our true purpose--pets and environmentalism--and our fall made our ability to govern impossible. This leads to a consequence of human folly, animal sacrifices, etc.
52. The manner of our creation being different, we are struck with the dynamic between dust and divinity.
53. **God gave us a measure of independent power**, we are not puppets. The locus of that power is our body, making it the primary area of power, freedom and responsibility. Our character is a reflection of our habitual ways and whether our body conforms to our conscious intentions.
54. That said, our bodies embody very little intrinsic power to do what we were called to do, leaving us to reach back to God as our power source, much like a robot will return to its charging station.
55. "We are a little less than God only because our life is one of such nature that it can draw upon the infinite resources of God."
