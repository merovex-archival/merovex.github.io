<h2>Postal Marine Series</h2>

<p>The series is about Danel Bophendze, an Imperial Postal Marine, who early on makes the mistake of being a naive boy who installs an ancient, manipulative AI in his brain. He ends up becoming a legend in the Marines, before turning his back on it all. It's rather cliche, but Bophendze adds new meaning to "going postal."<p>

	<p>With a wake of failed missions, operative Jonaldy Ammonet is given one-last chance in an organization where death is the only reward for failure. Recruiting the aid of Imperial Postal Marine Bophendze, Jonaldy saves a Dabrian imperial princess and her family from abduction only to find himself hunted with ruthless perfection by Creed Taneo, a living legend in the Bafiktuy Intelligence Directive who wants his hostages back. Jonaldy must decide between the hostages and himself in order to stop interference with Dabrian imperial succession.</p>

	Danel Bophendze's continuing battle with his inner demon keeps him at the edge of sanity

	Despite being a hero, David Bophendze's continuing battle with his inner demon keeps him at the edge of sanity. Creed Taneo's drive for perfection makes him a near-legend within the ultra-secretive Bafiktuy, as he quickly rises through the ranks after dozens of successful missions. Jonaldy Amonett failed as a courier for the Bafiktuy. One more failure could be his last.

	Now, Jonaldy is given an impossible mission: stop Creed from abducting a member of the Dabrian imperial family during a struggle over who should be the next emperor of the Pax Terradoma. With Bophendze's assistance, he succeeds, only to have Creed hunt them down with his ruthless perfection. They might save part of a royal family, but can Jonaldy and Bophendze save themselves? -->

	<p>On the verge of earning a plum job in government, pampered Mondennio Rownzal Clin-Khotaigra is falsely accused of cheating and is kicked out of university. He is faced with the injustices of Copa's clinate system, but when he's implicated in the murder of a magistrate, he must cope with his doubt in his own government's legitimacy to Bafiktuy Intelligence operative Jonaldy Amonett's efforts to compel him to be an agent for the Imperium.</p>

	<!-- The interstellar Terran Imperium is expanding to reclaim what was lost during the Decline—a period when hyperspace variances cleaved off countless human systems. The Clinate Oligarchy ruled Copa System for nearly 1,500 years, with every citizen identified as a contract line item. With the hyperspace route reestablished, the Imperium slowly infects Copan society—vying for control and peaceful transition.

	Despite enjoying the opulence as a sub-sept member of Clin-Khotaigra, University student Mondennio Rowenzal seeks higher status in government and society. His ambitions are shattered when he is caught cheating during a critical exam, setting him on a course that could decide the fate of his stellar system.

	Can he overcome Bafiktuy Intelligence operative Jonaldy Amonett's efforts to compel him to be an agent for the Imperium while doubting his own government's legitimacy?-->
