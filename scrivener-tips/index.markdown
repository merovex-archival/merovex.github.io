## Marking TODOs in Text

The Format/Inline Annotation command is designed for just this sort of thing. Anything you type within them will be automatically stripped out when you compile, by default. Chapter 18 goes over all of the various markings that are available, and how to search for them in the future.

Also documented in that chapter is the comments feature. If you want to simply highlight the text and "tag" it, that might work better. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  <span class="sr-only">Tip:</span> How insert a TODO:
  <ol>
    <li>Highlight the problem area</li>
    <li>Make a Comment with <strong>Shift-Cmd-8</strong></li>
    <li>Type in "TODO //" and then describe the problem. (or TK //, etc.)</li>
  </ol>
</div>

Use a saved search collection that checks for "TODO //". The slashes keep the phrase unique, and they also give me an effective "Done" system (if I’m not deleting it outright). You can use other symbols (e.g. "TODO -/") for Low Priority, etc.

This system also lets you categorise things a bit. "TODO /POST/" might only be spots that I’m concerned about the final appearance of, after I compile. Those I might not delete, if I need to review the formatting in that tricky area every time.

So the trick to getting your "Dynamic To-Do List" is to search for your tag, then select everything in the search results list and switch to Scrivenings mode. Now you can use that Comments sidebar column to locate TODO markers, click on them to scroll to the spot and address them. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  <span class="sr-only">Note:</span> You can use <strong>Cmd–0</strong> and <strong>Cmd–9</strong> in that sidebar to collapse/expand all notes, respectively).</div>
