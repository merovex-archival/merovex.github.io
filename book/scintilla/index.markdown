		<h1>PMS Book 4: Scintilla</h1>
		<p>On the verge of earning a plum job in government, pampered Mondennio Rownzal Clin-Khotaigra is falsely accused of cheating and is kicked out of university. He is faced with the injustices of Copa’s clinate system, but when he’s implicated in the murder of a magistrate, he must cope with his doubt in his own government’s legitimacy to Bafiktuy operative Jonaldy Amonett’s efforts to compel him to be an agent for the Imperium.</p>
