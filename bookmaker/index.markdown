Bookmaker provides authors a free, ruby-based production toolchain for self-published paper and electronic books using the [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) document preparation system. The code base borrows heavily from [Kitabu](https://github.com/fnando/kitabu), while replacing [Prince](http://princexml.com) as the PDF generator (due to licensing issues).

Bookmaker requires familiarity with LaTeX. Many TeX features are lacking when compiling to HTML, EPUB or MOBI.

What Does Bookmaker Provide?
----------------------------

* Write using LaTeX
* Paper Support: Book-quality PDF output (6"x9") using [Memoir](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir), suitable for publishing via [Createspace](https://www.createspace.com).
* Electronic Support: HTML, Epub and Mobi output (using [kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)).
* Table of Contents automatically generated from chapter titles

Installation
-------------

To install Bookmaker, you’ll need a working [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) 1.9+ installation.

    $ gem install bookmaker

<!--

After installing Bookmaker, run the following command to check your external
dependencies.

  $ bookmaker check

  KindleGen: Converts ePub e-books into .mobi files.
  Installed.

  html2text: Converts HTML documents into plain text.
  Not installed.

  pygments.rb: A generic syntax highlight. If installed, replaces CodeRay.
  Not installed.

There's no requirements here; just make sure you cleared the correct dependency based
on the formats you want to compile to.

How to Use Bookmaker
--------------------

To create a new Bookmaker project, execute the following on the command line:

    $ bookmaker new mybook

This command creates a directory <tt>mybook</tt> with the following structure (may be slightly different in production):

    mybook
    ├── _bookmaker.yml
    ├── images
    │   ├── cover.jpg
    │   └── dp-logo.png
    ├── output
    ├── templates
    │   ├── epub
    │   │   ├── cover.erb
    │   │   ├── cover.png
    │   │   ├── page.erb
    │   │   └── user.css
    │   └── html
    │       ├── layout.css
    │       ├── layout.erb
    │       ├── syntax.css
    │       └── user.css
    └── text
        └── 01_Chapter
            └──01_Welcome.tex

The <tt>_bookmaker.yml</tt> file holds the project's metadata. Update the relevant fields.

Now it's time to write your e-book. All your book content will be placed on the text directory. Bookmaker requires you to separate your book into chapters. A chapter is nothing but a directory that holds lots of text files. The e-book will be generated using every folder/file alphabetically. So be sure to use a sequential numbering as the name. Here's a sample:

  * text
    * 01_Introduction
      * 01_introduction.tex
    * 02_What_is_Ruby_on_Rails
      * 01_MVC.tex
      * 02_DRY.tex
      * 03_Convention_Over_Configuration.tex
    * 03_Installing_Ruby_on_Rails
      * 01_Installing.tex
      * 02_Mac_OS_X_instructions.tex
      * 03_Windows_instructions.tex
      * 04_Ubuntu_Linux_instructions.tex

Please note, **Kitabu** allows multiple file formats. **Bookmaker** only allows <tt>.tex</tt>.

When you're ready to view your progress, the commands below will compile the book into the <tt>output/</tt> directory in the appropriate format:

Compile into: PDF, HTML, Epub, Mobi

    $ bookmaker compile

Compile into a specific format:

    $ bookmaker compile --only [pdf|html|epub|mobi]

When compiling into HTML, Epub or Mobi, **Bookmaker** generates the Table of Contents (TOC) based on the h2-h6 tags. The h1 tag is discarded because it's meant to be the book title.

To print the TOC, you need to print a variable called +toc+, using the eRb tag.

    <%= toc %>

To create valid Mobi for Kindle, you need an appropriate cover image. **Bookmaker** looks for <tt>image/cover.jpg</tt>, and compiles it into the Epub and Mobi files. Refer to the Kindle documentation for the cover requirements.

### Dependencies

**Bookmaker** needs the following dependencies satisfied:

* [xelatex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX), available on via MacTeX (Mac) and MiKTex (Windows, unconfirmed). This is XeTeX supports UTF-8 encoded input by default (and only). Also, the fontspec package requires either XeTeX or LuaTeX to function; and XeTeX is more mature.
XeTeX supports TrueType/OpenType fonts directly
* LaTex to HTML conversion done within the gem itself.
* HTML to EPUB via [Merovex-EeePub](https://github.com/Merovex/eeepub). Install it directly from Github
* EPUB to Mobi via [Kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)
* Patience - This was developed for my own writing purposes, and is likely incomplete as of this writing.
