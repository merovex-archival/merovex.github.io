## Overview

This page is my attempt to distill my approach to getting published. It’s about creating the right series and novel design documentation. It’s about understanding the business aspect of self-publishing, and the slog involved.

The concept is to build a career from writing 8-novel series with a per-novel word count of 65,000 words (65 k-words) or 520,000 words (520 k-words) per-series.

## Sections

1. Overview
2. Business Plan
2. Plotting the Series
3. Developing the Characters
4. Writing the Series
5. Publication
