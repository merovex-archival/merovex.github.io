## Active Spotting

As implied, Active spotting involves constant or nearly constant movement.   When Active spotting, the Scout relies on his speed, agility, and camo rating to keep him alive.   Due to changes in the game, Suicide spotting has greatly decreased in popularity with experienced Scouts; however, Half Court spotting remains popular. Open and Suicide spotting is generally reserved for the most agile of Scouts. Any Scout is capable of Half Court spotting.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Suicide Spotting</h3>

Back in the old days when we all had to walk five miles in the snow with no shoes on just to get to our tanks before a battle - even on the Summer maps - Suicide spotting was common.   But times have  changed, tanks have changed and more importantly,  gun accuracy has changed, making Suicide runs much more difficult to pull off successfully.

Unfortunately, The Myths of Scouting have not changed.  The lower tiers are full of new players who are told that Suicide Rushes are THE way to Scout. So as players graduate upwards to the Tier IV Scouts, it is no wonder many of them think proper spotting = Suicide Rush.

Nothing could be farther from the truth.   If you are new to Scouts, do yourself a HUGE favor and repeat after me,

"Suicide Rushes are rarely the best way to spot."

Now repeat it again,

"Suicide Rushes are rarely the best way to spot."

The reason is this:   the countdown timer hits :00 and off you go, racing towards the enemy side of the map.   Before too long you are close enough to enemy tanks to light them up and, if you are lucky, blaze by a few of them and get close enough to light up most of their team.

"AWESOME! I am doing GREAT!"

Well... not really.  Look behind you when you get blown up.   Notice you can't even see any of your team mates?   Guess what?    They can't see any of the tanks you lit up.  Which means, they can't shoot any of the tanks you lit up.   Which means, you just died for nothing.

OOPS!

Meanwhile, the enemy Scout, who was smart enough NOT to Suicide, has begun to run a Half Court Spotting route which is lighting up your team's tanks AFTER his team pulled forward into locations from which they can fire on his spots.

You end up with 13 short-lived and totally unproductive spots but the other team ends up with the win.

OK, so Suicide spotting sucks and I should never do it then, right?

Wrong.

There are 4 times when Suiciding may make sense: 

**1:  Lots of Arty:** Let's say you're on Murovanka and there just happen to be 5 Arty per team.  Tell your Arty you will Suicide once they are set up and ask them to tell you when they are ready to fire.   Then say,

"Here is where I will go."

And outline your route in 2-3 clicks on the mini-map.

Now, when you Suicide, you have Arty already aimed in at the spots you will likely see tanks.  If you die after lighting up enemy tanks and Arty, you will probably have not done so in vain.   A situation like this is perfect for Suiciding.  If you can assist in taking out 2-3+ enemy Artillery early in the game, you have given your team a big advantage.

5 Artys or not,  if you decide to suicide at the same time 2 enemy T95s are lit up on the other side of map, you probably won't get much support.   Your Arty will be focused on those big exposed TDs, not on you. If you are getting ready to do a Suicide Run, you will get more support and be more successful if you wait until there is a lull in the action before you go for broke.

**2: To expose dug in tanks:**  Later in the game on Highway, you know the enemy has 3 TDs sitting up by the North base, waiting to demolish your team as they approach.  You have multiple tanks with good View Ranges sitting beside you in the Northwest corner.   You bush hop towards the river but can't uncover any of the TDs. So, you tell your team you will run in and make sure they are all loaded and ready to fire.  Then you gun your engine and go for broke.  Chances are you may not see any of them before they fire.  But when they do fire, you are now close enough to see them as you die, exposing them to your team's return fire.  Even if they don't die, your team now knows where they are and how to approach them in the most safe manner.

The same applies if an enemy Scout is well hidden and lighting up your team.  They are taken a beating, so it may be a good idea to rush the area where you suspect the enemy light is hiding and attempt to expose him.

**3:  To take the hit so a team mate can get a kill:** It is late in a game and 2 heavys are in a Peek-a-Boom standoff around the edge of a hill.  Your heavy is hurt - he can't afford to take a hit.  You don't have a viable way to come in from behind the enemy tank, so let your teammate know what you will do and pull out and try to flank the enemy.  If he shoots and kills you, your team mate can now safely pull out and score a free kill shot while the enemy reloads.  If the enemy misses or fails to kill you, you now have his flank.

**4: To reset cap:**  Sometimes the only way to reset cap and prevent a loss is to suicide either to provide spots or create the ability for you to reset on your own in hopes that your reset will give your team mates enough time to respond and pull out a win.

Note that the key to success in the first 3 of these scenarios is that you had support in place and ready to fire before you Suicided - AND they were aware on your intentions and committed to helping you.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Can deal a fast, fatal blow to the enemy.

Can break down an enemy killing field.

Can cause the enemy to focus on you instead of deploying properly.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Usually results in death, thus preventing you from helping your team later in the game.

Can produce little or no damage to the enemy team.

If performed as the game begins, provides intel of very little value.  Knowing the enemy team is, in fact, leaving spawn isn't exactly earthshaking news.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

Make certain you have support in place before you begin your Suicide Rush.

DO NOT drive straight.  Don’t make it easy for the enemy to kill you - and remember, it is quite likely they will see you before you see them.

Be unpredictable in your zigs and zags.   If you always turn left, turn right, turn left, turn right, you won't last much longer than if you simply drive straight.

Use terrain, environmental  objects, and foliage as much as possible to shield your approach until you are close enough to make your big move.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Open Active</h3>

Open Active spotting is a bit safer than Suiciding, but not much.  In Open Active, you circle around in the open close enough to the enemy to spot them.   The biggest difference between Open and Suicide is you don't plunge headfirst into the enemy formations; rather you stay farther away and bet that your agility will provide the "armor" you need to avoid incoming shots long enough for your team to smash the tanks you see.

While not as common as in the old days, when T-50-2s and pre-nerf T-50s scurried about mocking both enemy and the Laws of Physics alike, some Scouts still successfully pull off this technique.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Allows exposure of tanks, especially Snipers, Half Court and Passive Scouts may never see.

May cause enemy to focus on you instead of deploying or shooting bigger targets.

Can quickly transition into a Delayed Rush if a hole in the enemy line is found.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Frequently results in death.

Limited to the most agile and smaller Scouts.

Constant movement reduces your ability to effectively deal damage.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

Agility is imperative for success.  Don’t try this in a Pz38nA.

Size is also important.  The smaller your tank's profile, the better.  Luchs, ELC AMX , T71?  Go for it! But your Auf P probably isn't a great choice unless you are testing the enemy's ability to hit the side of a barn.

Once again, it is a good idea to get your team's support before heading out.  Success hinges on your team's ability to take out tanks you expose so it is a great idea to tell them you are about to go maniac.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Half Court</h3>

Half Court spotting is a much more conservative and much safer form of Open Active spotting.   You use superior View Range, speed, and terrain to provide your team spots while sticking close to cover at the most vulnerable portions of your route.

Think Prokhorovka.  That Scout who rushes up to the crest of the ridge running parallel across the middle of the map, perhaps barely crossing the crest, gaining spots, then darting back to the safety of his side of the map.  THAT is Half Court spotting.

You move towards the middle of the map and as soon as you light up a tank you turn around and begin a large circle; one which will allow you to come back and light him up again over and over until he is dead.  Then you go back, find another enemy and repeat the process, slowly moving up the field as you eliminate tanks.

It is an extremely effective method of spotting, especially if your team has Arty capable of hitting the far side of the map.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Allows spots across a much larger area of the map than Passive spotting.

Great at spotting holes in the enemy defense.

Can force your team to focus fire by only exposing 1-2 tanks at a time.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Frequently requires you to expose yourself to enemy fire, no matter how brief that exposure may be.

Usually will not expose locations of enemy Arty.

Effective on less than half our available maps.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

DO NOT get stuck in a pattern.  Pop up in different locations; don’t be predictable.  I frequently deliberately appear to turn left or right after reaching cover then, after certain I am totally invisible again, change direction and pop up on the opposite side of the field from where the enemy saw me going.  Surprise keeps you alive!

If you are spotted, drive erratically, even after reaching cover.  Enemy Arty will continue to have a shot at you after the other enemy tanks will not.

Use terrain features such as rocks and buildings as shields if you are spotted.

Only light up 1-2 tanks at a time.  Unlike Suicide and Open Active, you can often control how many tanks you see before circling around for another run.  Instead of lighting up 5-6 tanks, turn around as soon as 1-2 are lit up.  this forces your team to focus fire and helps eliminate your spots quickly.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Role Combos:
</th>
<td>

Half Court spotting can often combine with Anti-Scouting, Delayed Rushes, and on a limited basis, Sniping.
</td></tr></table>

<h3 class='no_toc'>General Rules For Active Spotting</h3>

Get the support of your team before you make your run.  It sucks to get great spots and die before your team even fires.

Use terrain features as much as possible to help keep you out of enemy Line of Sight and Line of Fire.

Be aware of opportunities to exploit seams in the enemy line.

Except for Half Court, small, agile Scouts work best.

## Anti-Scouting

Anti-Scouting is exactly what it sounds like; your job is to find enemy Scouts and destroy them.  While your main purpose in Anti-Scouting is to eliminate the enemy's eyes, you sometimes also Anti-Scout simply as a means of vision control or to deprive the enemy a path to your back lines.   The team that eliminates enemy Scouts while keeping theirs alive has a huge advantage for the remainder of the battle.  Because of this, if the enemy has any Scouts alive, you should ALWAYS be Anti-Scouting as either a primary or secondary role.

In the above quote, I combined 2 roles at once.  While set up to passive spot, I also got to my set up spot before the enemy Scout got to his and I was able to expose him to deadly allied fire early in the game.  Passive was my primary goal, Anti-Scouting was my secondary goal. As you tell from the commentary, both were successful and we rolled to an easy victory.

If you see an enemy Scout breaking for your rear lines, GO GET HIM!  Do not rely on your teammates to react - they can prove amazingly obtuse to what is transpiring on the battlefield.  So don't hesitate to respond.  Even if the Scout is on the opposite side of the map, start to intercept him.  If you see your team react, then you can break off your pursuit.  But until you see an adequate reaction from your team, assume you are the only person who will go get the guy.

As with Spotting, you can approach Anti-Scouting either passively or actively. No matter whether you set up passively or actively, the 3 steps of Anti-Scouting are the same: Locate, Intercept, and Eliminate.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Locate:</h3>

The means of locating him vary depending on how you decide to Anti-Scout but until you figure out where the sumbitch is, you can't take him out.   Many times you will spot the Scout yourself but, just as often, your first glimpse of him will come via the mini-map.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Intercept:</h3>

The means of locating him vary depending on how you decide to Anti-Scout but until you figure out where the sumbitch is, you can't take him out.   Many times you will spot the Scout yourself but, just as often, your first glimpse of him will come via the mini-map.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Eliminate:</h3>

Ahh...the fun part.   Either eliminate the tank or eliminate his threat as a spotter.  Hiding and getting free damage is always a great idea.  However, if you are protecting Arty, you may need to move in and ram him to keep him from infiltrating so far he lights them up.  Ram him to arrest his forward progress then take him out.  If no Arty is involved, only ram him if you need the emergency damage to save your own life or the life a of an ally.  Ramming costs you Hit Points; Hit Points which may be critical later in the game- spend them with care.  As always, if you can stay hidden and get your team to fire for you, all the better.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Passive Anti-scouting</h3>

You set up in a bush which provides overwatch along a known Scout infiltration route then you wait for an enemy Scout to come barreling down the route.  Unless the spot doubles as a good Passive Spotting bush don’t do this unless you have Arty to protect.   If the enemy Scouts are spotted in places where it is obvious they will not use the route you are watching and you aren't getting any other spots, go do something else.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

You frequently get the first shot and good position on the enemy Scout, a huge advantage in a 1 on 1 fight.

Almost always guarantees you will fight their Scout with help nearby for you and none nearby for him.  Those are the kinds of odds you want!

Many times your team will kill the Scout before you have to fire, allowing you to eliminate the enemy’s eye without ever being seen.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

If the enemy Scout never invades and you aren't in a good passive spotting bush, you end up wasting lots of time.

Less perceptive team mates may shoot or TK you for "not scouting".

If you guess wrong, the enemy Scout may go down a different route and still get to your Arty.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

Turn your scout around so it is facing the direction you will most likely pull out in to begin your interception or pursuit.

Tell your team what you plan to do during the countdown timer.    Don't wait until some goofball on your team shoots you to attempt to explain why you are where you are.

The moment you see the enemy Scouts in other areas of the map doing other things, switch roles.   Don’t waste time waiting on an enemy which isn't headed for your trap. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Role Combos:
</th>
<td>

On many maps, Passive Anti-Scouting can combine with Passive Spotting.
</td></tr></table>

<h3 class='no_toc'>Active Anti-scouting</h3>

Active Anti-Scouting is much more fluid and dynamic.  You are constantly moving around your half of the map until an enemy Scout is spotted then you zoom in and kill him.

While your goal is to eliminate enemy Scouts, it is also to deny them spots on your team.  Frequently shadowing or mirroring a Scout will do this.  Shadowing is simply copying their movements on your side of the map.  If you move laterally with them, you prevent them from popping too far over mid-field and getting good spots because the moment they attempt to spot, they are seen and open to fire.  You can also time their movements to give you chances to fire at them.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Staying at full speed allows you to quickly react to any situation on the battlefield.

Allows you to Anti-Scout and spot at the same time.

Allows you to bait enemy Scouts and pull them into a field of fire.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Your location is frequently known to the enemy.

Much more risky than Passive Anti-Scouting if you do not have Sixth Sense.

Initial shots are low percentage on-the-move shots.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

If the enemy Scout is shadowing you, he probably knows what he is doing - treat him with respect.

Be wary of chasing Scouts onto their side of the map.  They are probably trying to bait you just as you are trying to bait them.

"Welcome to my web said the spider to the fly."  Be the spider - not the fly.

</td></tr></table>

<h3 class='no_toc'>General Rules For Anti-scouting</h3>

Unless you have Arty, and usually even just 1 Arty isn't enough, you should not set up in an Anti-Scout passive bush that doesn't double as a Passive Spotting location.   You will help your team more spotting enemy tanks.

Remember, as long as the enemy has Scouts alive, if you are doing something else, your secondary role should be Anti-Scouting.  Not many or none of your team mates will have the speed needed to intercept an enemy Scout if he makes a break through your lines.

Be alert to your team taking damage from invisible tanks.  This means their Scout is getting spots.  Use your knowledge of the maps to determine where he is and try to expose him and/or call for fire into his hiding spot before your team gets too far behind.  It is sometimes worth dying to expose a Scout who is lighting up your team.

## Arty Guard

General William Tecumseh Sherman, in summing up the value of artillery, said:

*"A battery of field artillery is worth a thousand muskets."*

While Artillery does not have as much impact on the game (was that a pun?) as it used to, your SPGs can still be valuable assets.  You should try to protect them, if practical.  Note I said "if practical", not "if possible". Depending on the situation and map, it may not make sense to guard them.  There are times when it is better they die than you die.  In war, sacrifices must be made.

During World War II, in the early days of the 8th Army Air Force (8 AAF) in Europe, allied bomber formations were taking huge losses from German fighters. Allied fighters typically deployed close to the bombers and attempted to engage the Luftwaffe as they attacked the bombers. Robert Johnson (who went on to become the leading US ace in Europe) fought long and hard with the 8 AAF brass to change how they guarded their bombers. He contended that moving allied fighters out further away from the bombers would allow them to fend off attacks before the Germans got within range of the bombers, thereby reducing bomber losses. Once the 8 AAF finally agreed to test his theory, it proved wildly successful and was adopted as standard procedure.

The same concept applies to guarding Arty. If you camp right next to the Arty you are trying to guard, you can not adequately defend them! Whatever you can see and shoot at can also see and shoot at the Arty. You need to intercept enemy tanks as far from your Arty as possible.

To do that you need to be Anti-Scouting out, away from the Arty you are guarding, not close to them. Once engaged, do everything possible to stop them before they get close enough to spot your Arty. Shoot them. Ram them. Pin them against rocks or tanks. Just keep them out of spot range of your Arty.

Sometimes, no matter how vigilant you are, a tank will break through and get to your Arty. What do you then? If at all possible, get between the enemy tank and your Arty. Force them to either shoot you or hold their shot to try to get around you and get a shot on your SPG.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Keeping Arty alive can potentially win a fight.

Killing enemy Scouts while defending Arty helps your team multiple ways: your Arty stays alive; their Scouts die.

You save some Arty's life and guess who will be looking to help you out the next battle you play together in.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Cons:</th>
   <td>

If you take big damage or die protecting Arty, your team may end up worse off than if you had simply let the Arty die.

You can end up back in the rear lines, unavailable to help elsewhere at a critical time.

While you are saving Arty, your eyes aren't helping along the front lines.

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>Prime Considerations:</th>
   <td>

If you are on a map on which Arty can't play well (Himmelsdorf, for example), guarding arty should normally take a lower priority than helping your team elsewhere.

Tracking the infiltrator will prevent him from getting close enough to see your Arty.

Sometimes it is best to let the enemy shoot your Arty and let his fixation on the SPG give you free shots on him.  By the time he kills the Arty, you have him mortally wounded or dead.

## Arty Hunting

Napoleon Bonaparte once stated:

*"God fights on the side with the best artillery."*

One of your roles as a Scout is to make sure God fights on your side.  At times, that means protecting your Arty.  Other times, that means destroying the enemy Arty.   This tutorial deals with the latter choice: Arty Hunting.

With the exception of those serendipitous times when you spot Arty from range and can snipe them, you must go find them.  Whether you go for broke and Suicide Rush, bide your time and Delay Rush, or find them in Search and Destroy mode later in the game, the following 6 Rules of Arty Hunting can guide you through the process.

<h3 class='no_toc'>The 6 Rules Of Arty Hunting:</h3>

The first 3 rules deal with getting to Arty Land:

**1: Go where they ain't:**  This should seem obvious but if sense were truly common, everyone would have it.  How many times have you seen an ally rush straight into the midst of the enemy lines or intercepted an enemy Scout who beelines straight towards your rear lines with no thought to where your team is deployed?  Don't be those guys.  Use Quick Counts and Situational Awareness to ascertain when and where a seam exists in the enemy defense. Set your infiltration route up for success and plan a path which avoids as many enemy tanks as possible.

**2: Go where they can't see you:** it isn't just enough to avoid known enemy tank locations.  You should also take a route which uses environmental concealment to hide or mask your infiltration.   Terrains changes, terraces, hills, buildings, trees, rocks and more can help hide you as you move towards Arty Land.  The ability to stay hidden until you pop out on Arty is often the difference between success and failure.  The ultimate infiltration is the one where the enemy has no idea where you are until their first Artillery falls before your gun.

**3: Don't stop if you take 1-2 hits:**  There are times when you WILL be spotted and take enemy fire as you rush.  If you have planned your route well, most of the time, this is simply Target of Opportunity fire and you will quickly move out of the enemy's line of sight and line of fire.   Don't let 1-2 random shots dissuade you from reaching your goal.   Adjust your path to provide additional cover if needed and keep going.

The only times you should abort your route is if you take crit hits which make continuing impossible, success unlikely or when you have misjudged the enemy resistance along your route and face insurmountable odds in front of you.  Dead heroes rarely win battles.

*"Discretion is the better part of valor"* but remember also, *"To valor goes the victory."*  Unless the situation is hopeless, Charlie Mike soldier!  (Charlie Mike is the phonetic pronunciation of the letters "C" and "M".  In US Army lingo, it means "Continue the Mission.")

Follow these 3 rules for infiltration well and soon you will arrive in Arty Land, ready to cleanse the heathens with a little Holy Fire.  The next 3 rules deal with fighting Arty once you find them:

**4:  Prioritize targets based on whom is the biggest threat:**  Watch for tracers as you approach.  Not only will tracers help you locate Arty, they will also help you know which Arty has recently fired and is not a threat for a short period of time.  Knowing which Arty has fired and which have not is a true lifesaver.  Additional, note which Arty is pointed towards you and which are not.  Focus on the Arty ready to fire and pointed towards you first and ignore the ones which have just fired or are pointed the opposite way and are currently harmless.

**5: Use Arty, dead or alive, as a shield from other threats:**  When mixing it up with multiple Artillery, it is often possible to use them as shields from each other or from other threats.  Their slow traverse rate makes it easy for you to get beside or behind them and use their bulk to provide temporary cover for your tank.

**6: Don't stop moving:**  One of the most common - and deadly - mistakes people make when engaging Arty is stopping to get a good stable shot.  Your ability to aim on the move is MUCH better than is Arty's.  Don't make it easy on them by stopping.  If possible, keep them traversing their turret (if they have one) and tank to make yourself as difficult to hit as possible.  DO NOT STOP!  If approaching them head on, try to move to one side or the other and cross over their line of fire just as they get you lined up.  Force them to keep rotating; it reduces their accuracy tremendously.

There are 2 exceptions to the Do Not Stop! rule:  The first is if the Arty fires and misses you.  If you are otherwise safe from incoming fire then stopping to take the guy out is fine if he isn't an auto-loader.  The second exception is when you gain their side or rear and are using their hull as a position of cover while you kill them and/or other targets.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Eliminating enemy Arty allows your big slow tanks to use more open locations on the battlefield.

Killing enemy Artillery often provides a psychological kick in the enemy's pants.

Getting free among enemy Arty forces them to collapse back and deal with you, raising the odds of success along the main battle front.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Cons:</th>
   <td>

If you misjudge the location of enemy tanks, you can die a horribly swift and pointless death.

You can end up trapped deep behind enemy lines with no allies able to help you out.

With Artillery no longer as lethal as they used to be, sometimes there are better things to do behind lines than hunt Arty.

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>Prime Considerations:</th>
   <td>

Don't risk dying when you can spot instead.  I know it is fun to kill Arty yourself but if you can passive spot from a safe position and let your team mates take them out, do so.  You are more valuable to your team alive than dead.

Do not side hug unless you have to.  At times you must get right up, close and personal, to an enemy Arty in order to control their movement or screen yourself from other enemy tanks.  However, whenever possible, keep a distance of several meters from their sides and dance with them.   Nothing ruins an Arty Hunting festival faster than allied Arty shooting the tank you are hugging and taking you out with friendly fire.  No, they are not smart enough to fire at the Arty you are not hugging.  Furthermore, if you are using HE, you can damage, crit hit, or even kill yourself when you fire at a target within your own splash zone. Blowing yourself up is never a good way to impress your team or your WOT groupies.

Be aware Arty can sometime indirectly blast you by shooting an object you are up against.  Just as you shooting the Arty point blank can cause self-inflicted damage, Arty can shoot the rock, wall, dead tank, etc you are up against and cause major splash damage to your tank.

When time is of the essence - RAM!   When you know you have limited time to produce a kill and you are in a capable Scout tank, ramming becomes a viable option.

Know your maps.  Learn where Arty likes to set up on each map.  Learn which approach routes let you infiltrate stealthily.  Learn what points let you set up and spot/snipe while still at a safe, standoff distance. Just as importantly, learn where enemy like to set up to guard the route you are taking.

Know your Artillery.  Knowing the approximate range of Arty helps you find them.  The FV304 or Tier III Arty probably isn't along the back lines.  The M53/M55 probably is.  Knowing their approximate reload times allows you to quickly plot a course of action based on which Arty has fired and which hasn't.  Knowing how fast they can traverse also helps plan your course of action once you engage.  That GW-Panther will be able to follow your movement much more quickly than will the GW-Tiger

## Capper


Capping is one of 3 ways to win a pub match (the other 2 being killing all enemy tanks and denying victory to the team on Offense in Assault).


Long ago, Capping was a common and acceptable way to win battles.  So common and acceptable, in fact, on the original Komarin map, group fast capping from the start of the battle was a popular tactic.  Unfortunately, the WNx crowd has browbeat many people into submission about Capping.  Despite Capping being a viable way to win battles, and despite winning battles being the objective of the game, they denigrate and castigate those who cap until many players now think it is bad to cap - how WRONG they are!


There are 2 very good reasons to cap.  The first reason is to win the game (duh!).  The second is to Distract the enemy away from the front lines by forcing them to pull back tanks to reset you or risk losing. Let's look more closely at both reasons:


<h3 class='no_toc'>CAPPING TO WIN</h3>


Standard and assault battles award tanks 1 cap point/second, with a maximum of 3 pts/second awarded. Encounter battles award tanks 1 cap point/2.5 seconds, with a maximum of 3 points awarded every 2.5 seconds.  This means it takes a solo tank 1:40 to complete cap on Standard/Assault maps while it takes that same tank 4:10 to complete cap in Encounter.


With 2 tanks capping, the time becomes :50 and 2:05, respectively.  With 3 tanks, cap times are :34 (33:3, but it rounds up) and 1:23 minutes to complete cap.  More than 3 tanks capping will not reduce the cap time further because of the max cap point/second limitations.


When more than 3 tanks cap, they each receive an equal portion of the 3 cap points.  Thus, while extra tanks don't speed up cap, they do spread out the wealth and make it more difficult to reset a cap.


Completing cap is not enough to ensure victory; 1 more condition must be met.  After completing cap, 5 seconds must transpire without any tank dying.  If a tank dies during those 5 seconds (any tank, on either team), the 5 second timer starts anew and continues to reset every time another tank dies within the new 5 seconds.  That means it is possible to complete cap and still lose the battle!


Consider this:  You are the lone survivor on your team and are attempting to cap to win.  You manage to complete your cap but during the next 5 seconds the enemy team kills you. Your team loses.


Or, consider this: you are in a cap race with the other team and are ahead by 8 seconds.  However, the stat whore, damage-uber-alles fools on your team are too obtuse to realize they have won and kill an enemy tank 4 seconds after you complete cap.  The 5 second timer resets, extending the game, and during the new 5 seconds, the enemy team completes their cap.  Your Victory turns into a Draw.


Situational Awareness applies to all facets of the game - including the period after cap completion!


<h3 class='no_toc'>CAPPING TO DISTRACT</h3>


A stalemate exists on the battlefield, or perhaps you are losing.  Capping can force the enemy to send some tanks back to reset you and alleviate pressure on the front lines and/or tip the scales in your favor.  If no one comes back after you, guess what?  You are now capping to win!


But if enemy tanks do come back, remember your goal is simply to Distract; get out of Dodge before your escape is impossible.  Better to stay alive and continue to harass the enemy then die trying to complete a Cap you have no chance of completing.

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR CAPPING</h3>


Only Cap to Win if Capping will win the game faster than Killing.

Use any available environmental cover/concealment on the Cap area to stay hidden.

Do not shoot enemy tanks during the 5 second timer after you have completed Cap unless you are 100% certain you will not kill them.

Do not shoot enemy tanks during the 5 second timer after you have completed Cap unless you are 100% certain YOU will not die doing so.


## Defender

No matter how good you are at World of Tanks, no matter how well you rock a Scout tank, at some point you will have battles where you have to assume the role of Defender.  You will have to reset an enemy cap. If only 1 tank is capping, your task is pretty straight forward - kill the Invader.  However, if more than 1 tank is capping, your task becomes much more difficult and standard rules no longer always apply.

Most of the time, your goal is to eliminate guns.  In Base Defense this changes.  Instead of eliminating guns, your goal switches to eliminating Capture Points.  Every enemy tank on your base slowly builds up its own bank of Capture Points - each at a rate of 1 point per second (1 point per 2.5 seconds in Encounter  Mode).  A team gets maximum of 3 Cap Points per tick so with up to 3 tanks capping, each tank get 1 point per second.  If 4 or more tanks are capping, those 3 points are split evenly between them.

Thus, if 4 tanks are capping and you hit one of them over and over, you will eventually lose.  While you keep knocking 1 tank's bank of Points back to zero, the other 3 tanks keep building up their Points.  When their combined banks equal 100, you lose.

Therefore, the strategy in defending base is to keep everyone's banks as close to zero as possible.  This means you must rotate your targets.  Common sense applies.  If the enemy isn't close to 100 total and 1 of their tanks is low health, eliminate him first.  But if their Capture Points are building, you need to rotate targets and reduce the overall total.

Hopefully, help is on the way.

Here is an illustration using 3 Invading tanks.  They all have 600 Hit Points and by the time you get there, they all have 22 Cap Points in their bank. You are HE and will do 120 damage per shot every 7 seconds.

A 600HP (22 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (22 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (22 CAP)

Total CAP: 66


You fire at TANK A.  7 seconds later, when you are ready to fire again, the situation looks like this:


A 480HP (7 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (29 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (29 CAP)

Total CAP: 65

You fire at TANK A.  7 seconds later, when you are ready to fire again, the situation looks like this:


A 240HP (7 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (43 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (43 CAP)

Total CAP: 93

p>You fire at TANK A.  7 seconds later, when you are ready to fire again, the situation looks like this:

A 120HP (7 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (50 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (50 CAP)

Total CAP: 107
Because you kept firing at the same tank, the other 2 tanks kept building up their cap Banks and just 33 seconds later (28 seconds to get to 100 plus 5 seconds to keep it there), they complete Cap and Win - and you didn't even kill the tank you were shooting at!


Now let's look at exactly the same situation; but this time, you rotate your target:


A 600HP (22 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (22 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (22 CAP)

Total CAP: 66


You fire at TANK A.  7 seconds later, when you are ready to fire again, the situation looks like this:


A 480HP (7 CAP)

PRED B 600HP (29 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (29 CAP)

A 480HP (14 CAP)

PRED B 480HP (7 CAP)

PBLUE C 600HP (36 CAP)

Total CAP: 57

Total CAP: 42

Hey - look what happened: their total stayed the same!  If you can continue to shoot without dying, they will never get to 100.  Obviously that is too much to hope for but the point is this:  if you rotate targets, you drastically slow down the enemy's build up of Points and give your teammates more time to come help out.  If you concentrate solely on 1 target, you dramatically reduce the time you give your allies to react.


I have seen instances where 3 or 4 teammates fire  at 4 different enemy tanks and end up blowing them to bits - but lose because a 5th little tank hides in the back and is never hit.  Rotate targets - ALL targets.


Now, you will rarely find situations as idealized as the scenario I just presented, so here are some Rules of Thumb for defending your base (use the order they are presented as your Decision Tree in deciding whom to shoot next):

1. SHOOT THE TANKS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE THE LONGEST (or gone the longest without being hit) FIRST


Remember your goal is to eliminate Capture Points.  If you know which tanks have been on cap the longest, target them first - they have the most Points in their bank.


2. IF YOU CAN KILL AN INVADER QUICKLY, DO IT


Even if takes 2-3 shots, if you can kill 1 of them AND still prevent them from reaching 100 total, do it.


3. ROTATE TARGETS EVERY SHOT


As I just demonstrated, this is the only way to effectively defend your base til help arrives.

One final tip for Defending Base:  When going up against heavily armored targets and/or when Cap is almost complete and you MUST score damage for an immediate reset:  USE HE!

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR DEFENDER</h3>


Follow the Rules of Thumb for target prioritization.

If time allows, and you are being spotted when you fire, shift locations between attacks. Dead tanks can't defend.

If your team is on the way to help and you have no alternatives, suicide to gain a reset.  Giving up your tank may buy enough time for your team to pull out a victory.


## Delayed Rush

Unless you Suicide Rush or Team Rush, chances are you will spend the initial stages of the battle on your side of the map.  As the game begins to unfold, seams usually appear in the enemy deployment.  Frequently, you can exploit these seams by conducting a Delayed Rush.  A Delayed Rush is simply a rush into the enemy's rear done after the initial stage of the game is over. The Delayed Rush can occur in stages; it does not have to be one long uninterrupted rush. Sometimes, stopping at a well placed bush to survey the upcoming terrain will help you avoid surprises.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>

Delaying your rush allows you to successfully infiltrate behind enemy lines much more often than a Suicide Rush.

Sets up a quick transition into other Scout Roles which help your team.

Demoralizing to the other team when you suddenly pop out behind them.

</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>CONS:</th>
   <td>

If you have miscounted enemy tanks, can lead to a quick death.

If the enemy reacts quickly, you may end up isolated behind lines with no help nearby.

Although rare, going behind enemy lines can sometimes put you in a worse position from which to help your team.

 <tr>
   <th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
   <td>

Have an escape plan in mind as you go - you may need it!

  <th>ROLE COMBOS:</th>
  <td>
  Delayed Rushes normally turn into Arty Hunting, Active Spotting, Distraction, Search and Destroy, Flanking, and/or Capping.

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR DELAYED RUSHES</h3>


Ideally, your Quick Counts have accounted for all but 3 or less enemy tanks before you start your Rush.

Tell your Arty where you are going before you go.

Plan your route so it uses as much environmental camo as possible; avoid crossing open terrain if you can.

Remain flexible! Don't get locked so hard into 1 goal you fail to exploit a better opportunity to help your team.


## Distraction


Distraction Scouting is used to gain the enemy's attention; to take his mind off whatever objective he is currently pursuing.

Large-scale, this tactic is most commonly used to try to relieve pressure from an area where the enemy is advancing or about to break through. For example, your team is losing ground
on the east side of Erlenberg.  You rush down the middle by the river, deliberately exposing yourself briefly to the enemy, hoping to draw off 1-2 of the attackers
so that your team and regroup and solidify their defense. Or perhaps, the two sides are at a stalemate.  You sneak through all the way to their base and begin to cap.  Your immediate goal isn't to complete your cap, it is to pull enemy back to try to reset you so that your team gains a numerical advantage at the point of attack.

On a smaller scale, it is used to get a specific tank or group of tanks to focus on you so an ally can gain an advantageous position with minimal risk of taking fire.  You and another tank are both being held up by a heavy.  Get past him and you have a clear path to Arty Land.  You co-ordinate with your ally, then pull out enough to get the heavy to focus on you, allowing your friend to make a mad dash past him to safety beyond.

Sometimes, the Distraction may be running full speed through an enemy formation, gun blazing, and then exiting stage left behind a group of buildings, over a hill, or into thick bushes which will soon mask your location.

Worst case, your Distraction may involve the ultimate sacrifice - deliberately absorbing a round from the enemy in order to allow a bigger, nearly dead, allied tank to take a well aimed kill shot on the target.

No matter how the scenario plays out, the goal is the same:  to force the enemy to respond to you in order to gain advantage or lessen disadvantage on the battlefield.
<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>
 Can turn the tide of the battle.

   <td>

Don't use this technique unless needed.

</td></tr></table>

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR DISTRACTION SCOUTING</h3>


Unless you are headed for a Distraction cap, at some point, you must reveal yourself to the enemy.  They can't become distracted by a ghost.

Pick exposure areas which allow nearby, easy access cover or concealment.

Exposing yourself 1 time probably won't suffice in many cases.  Your goal is to irritate the enemy so much they react to you.


## Flanker

Flanking is a mainstay of fast Medium Tanks.  With your speed, you excel at it, too.  Flanking someone means getting on their flank (side) or rear, allowing you to fire into their weakest points of armor.  It is extremely effective if another tank is already engaging them from the front.  Once flanked, the enemy has no way to escape fire from the side or rear.  If he faces one tank, the other gets a flank shot.  If he turns to face them, the first tank gets his flank.


While frequently employed as a team, flanking is also extremely effective when solo against TDs and SPGs.  In fact, it is the recommended way of attacking them.   Only the brave and foolhardy approach either from the front.   If you value your life, you will always strive to approach TDs and SPGs from the side or gain their flank as soon as possible.

If you know the target will take several shots to kill (as most higher Tier TDs will), you should get as close to the enemy tank as possible to hinder his ability to turn and face you.  There are 2 ways to do this.


In the first, get to his side, then move in concert with him to maintain your position on his flank.  However, be aware: if you are right up against him and fire directly at him, you may damage yourself with the shot if you use HE.  I tend to stay a few meters away from my target and shift position with him in order to avoid damaging myself, but this is not always possible if you wish to keep him from facing you. Additionally, if friendly Arty fires at him, they may hit pr splash you.


The second method is more effective.  Get yourself right up against the enemy's rear.  It is easy to shift with him and maintain your position.  At the same time, it is easy to back up a few meters, take a shot with no risk of damaging yourself, then reengage him before he can turn.  Additionally, if the enemy has a forward placed gun assembly, you can fire right into the back of it without having to back and with no risk of damaging your own tank

<table class='table'>

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR SNIPING</h3>

If ganging an enemy, watch his turret and back out if he decides to target you.

Keep watching that mini-map.  Don't let easy damage distract you from what is happening on the rest of the map.

If a friendly tank is circling your target, only shoot when he is on the opposite side of your target. It's a great way to avoid accidental friendly fire.


## Peak-a-View

Many of you are familiar with the Peek-a-Boo/Peek-a-Boom style of fighting.   Peek-a-View spotting is the same concept, but with spots as the goal instead of damage.  The Scout hides behind a building, rock, terrain change, etc then pops out just far enough to get spots before quickly retreating back behind his cover.

Obviously, this is highly risky.  You are essentially playing a game of Whack-a-Mole with only 1 or 2 holes - and YOU are the mole.  Despite the risk, Peek-a-View is an outstanding tool to have in your bag of tricks.

Think Malinovka and the passage by the water's edge along the north edge of the central pond/swamp.  The ramp at either end of that path is perfect for Peek-a-View spotting.  You pop up, get spots and immediately retreat a bit back down the ramp, becoming immune to enemy fire.   As soon as the spots disappear, you do it again.

The same technique is useful on maps and in battles across the spectrum of WOT.  All you need is a terrain feature to provide cover, tanks to spot, and the skill and willingness to take a risk for your team.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>

Provides spots in areas where Passive and Active spotting may not work.

Usable anywhere you have something to provide cover.

Creates a huge distraction for the enemy team.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>CONS:</th>
   <td>

Vulnerable to enemy fire when you pop up; they know where you are after the first time you do it.

Often results in you getting “stuck” behind you cover until enemy spots are killed.

Frequently vulnerable to enemy flanking movements.

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
   <td>

Use this style of spotting only when Passive or Active won’t work.
 
If possible, pop out of cover at different spots.  Peek around the left side of the rock, then the right but don't be predictable!  Vary your timing, as well.

Only pull out far enough to get spots unless you are certain the enemy tanks are not aimed in at you.   Most of the time, you are more valuable as a spotter than as a sniper.

Before you pop out the first time, it helps to tell your team, especially if you have Arty, to aim in on the location you are about to see tanks.

 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <th>ROLE COMBOS:</th>
   <td>
   If no one is aimed in on you, can sometimes be combined with Sniping.

</td></tr></table>

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR ACTIVE SPOTTING</h3>


Get the support of your team before you make your run.  It sucks to get great spots and die before your team even fires.

Use terrain features as much as possible to help keep you out of enemy Line of Sight and Line of Fire.

Be aware of opportunities to exploit seams in the enemy line.

Except for Half Court, small, agile Scouts work best.


## Proxy

When tanks move to a distance 49m or less apart from each other, they automatically light each other up.  This is called Proximity spotting, or Proxy spotting, for short.   It doesn't matter if rocks, buildings, whatever is in between them.  Line of Sight is not required.

Scouts can take great advantage of this.

On maps such as Karelia Assault, the defending team often sends a tank to the base of the balcony on top the Donut to light up snipers.   Teams in Sand River Assault often do the same thing.  Sometimes the most effective way to expose tanks on the Mines central hill is to simply run around the base of the hill, Proxy spotting hidden tanks as you go.

If you think about it, Proxy spotting can be used literally anywhere there are enemy tanks.  As battles progress, an alert Scout can frequently find times where he can sneak up to a rock or building and expose an enemy tank he knows is hiding on the opposite side.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>

Can expose enemy tanks in situations where Line of Sight spotting is unattainable.

Can completely neutralize an enemy tank.

Usable on every map.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>CONS:</th>
   <td>

By default, you are always lit up when you Proxy.

Susceptible to Arty, flankers, and snipers since they know where you are.

Vulnerabilities limit its use.

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
   <td>

Use this style of spotting only when Passive or Active won't work.
 
Because you are exposed when you Proxy, you must have a great handle on where enemy tanks are before you attempt it.

Pay close attention to the mini-map so you can egress before enemy flankers and/or snipers move into position to attack you.

If needed and possible, playing ring-around-the-rosie with the enemy vehicle can keep you alive long enough for your team to eliminate the tank you are spotting.

If your team has no one able to shoot your spot, you may end up accomplishing nothing but trapping yourself in an untenable position.  Don't proxy unless you have support available!

 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <th>ROLE COMBOS:</th>
   <td>
   Because Proxy spotting puts you in a vulnerable position dependent on your team's support, it is difficult to combine with other Scout roles.

</td></tr></table>

## Search and Destroy (SAD)

Search and Destroy is pretty much a straight forward role:  you go out, find unseen tanks, and kill them.


The farther into the match you progress, the more likely this technique may be needed. As the match progresses, it may become apparent an enemy Scout is lighting your team up. An enemy TD may remain undiscovered, holding up a prime line of advancement. Injured tanks may have retreated to the rear, waiting to fight in last ditch efforts to stave off defeat or appear suddenly to help pull out a win. Your job is to find them and to kill them, or at least light them up long enough for your team to take them out. 
<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>

Your speed and firepower make you ideally suited for the task.

Attrition-riddled enemy forces usually offer much less resistance than that against probes earlier in the game.

Ability to rack up multiple easy kills as you eliminate already-damaged foes.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>CONS:</th>
   <td>

Hidden enemy can see you coming and get several good shots off before you can react.

You frequently go in alone meaning you may end up 1 against several.

Losing your tank before inflicting much damage on the enemy can swing the battle in the enemy's favor. 

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
   <td>

Use your Situational Awareness to improve your odds.  Where was a tank last seen?  What areas have yet to be scouted? Where would they be based on what they need to be doing in the battle?

Remember, if you run way out in front of your support, you will end up facing whatever you find by yourself.

In light of the above truth, it is sometimes not a bad idea to wait for your team to catch up before you make your big move on a spot where you expect to find enemy.

## Sniper


Scout tanks are not blessed with an abundance of Hit Points.  This makes conservation of one's Hit Points highly desirable.  That presents a Catch-22 for Scouts.  How does one produce damage and conserve Hit Points at the same time?  Passive Spotting is the most common answer.  But Passive Spotting doesn't do much once forces have engaged on a channel map, a city map, or most other maps.  Once tanks in a firefight can see each other, your usefulness as a Passive Spotter drops to zero.  

So what to do?


One possibility is become a Sniper!  Instead of sitting around idly until a seam opens up to rush through, help create the seam by firing at the enemy from a stand-off distance. Exploit your superior View Range and knowledge of concealment.


The ultimate position as a Sniper allows one to fire repeatedly at an enemy and remain unseen.  However, there are many times this won't be possible. In lieu of firing and remaining hidden, it is also effective to setup unseen, fire and become exposed, retreat and re-establish concealment, then repeat the process.  A great example of this is the middle ridge in Sand River Assault Offense.  The Scout goes near the edge of the ridge, gains a target and fires, exposing himself to the enemy.  The Scout retreats backwards down the ridge out of Line of Fire, waits to re-establish invisibility, then repeats the procedure.  Especially if the Scout varies the location from which he sets up and fires, he can do this over and over in relative safety. The key is having cover close enough to prevent getting hit after he fires.

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>PROS:</th>
    <td>

Allows you to produce damage in a safe manner.

Can be both frustrating and disconcerting to an enemy who is taking damage from someone he can not see.

Remaining hidden from enemy view keeps them wondering where you are.

</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
   <th>CONS:</th>
   <td>

May cause team mates to question why you aren't spotting.

May put you too far away to rapidly respond to other problems.

May not work well with all Scout guns. For example, the 3cm available on the Luchs and VK 16.02 is a horrible Sniper gun.

</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
   <td>

Lead your target if it is moving. Shooting a moving target where it is now almost guarantees a miss.  The trick is to shoot where it will be when the round gets there.

Gravity works in WOT! The longer the shot, the farther your round will drop.  Adjust your aim as needed.

Have cover handy unless you are certain no one will spot you when you fire.

Remain aware of everything else happening on the battlefield.  When tankers go into Sniper Mode when aiming, they tend to forget SA.  This can be a fatal mistake both for you and for the team.

<h3 class='no_toc'>GENERAL RULES FOR SNIPING</h3>


If the target is shooting back at you, you aren't Sniping, you're Brawling.  Avoid Brawling in a Scout tank.

Distance can provide the same concealment as a bush if you are far enough away.

It is best to have cover or a quick escape route handy.


## Team Rush


The Team Rush is probably the least used of the many Scout roles, but it can be one of the most fun when you get a chance to employ it.

In Team Rush, multiple Scouts invade enemy land in a mass Suicide Rush.  A single, well executed Suicide Rush can prove difficult for the enemy to deal with but a Suicide rush by multiple Scouts can drive the enemy downright mad. However, you need specific conditions to exist for a Team Rush to succeed and those conditions rarely occur.
 
CONDITIONS FOR A SUCCESSFUL TEAM RUSH:

1. Multiple agile Scouts:   A group of Pz38nAs will be nowhere near as effective as a group of Luchs. A group of T49s won't be nearly as effective as a group of WZ-132s and Ru 251s.
2. Multiple Arty:  Exposing 10-15 enemy at a time does no good unless you have several Arty to shoot them.
3. Confirmation from allied Scouts:  Team Rush isn't something you suggest in chat and do without affirmation from the other Scouts.  Unless they tell you they are going with you, assume they are not or else you will find yourself on a solo Suicide Rush.  Because it is hard to co-ordinate in pubs, Team Rushes are usually easiest to pull off in a 3 man Scout platoon.

Long ago, on the old Komarin map we had a battle with 3 Arty and 5 Scouts on our team (none of the Scouts were platooned: 3 T-50-2s, a T-50 and my VK 28.01).  All the Scouts agreed to Team Rush.  We hit the enemy spawn as fast as we could and what resulted was the single most fun mission I have ever had in WOT.  NONE of our Scouts ended up dying.  Somehow we managed to avoid hitting each other while driving in and out of the enemy tanks and circling them like crazy.  It was a magical battle.  Our Arty had a field day and thanks to my Derp I ended up with a Top Gun.  We ended up winning 15-0.

Don't expect similar outcomes.  Most of the time you Team Rush, you will die.  The trick is for your Scouts to stay alive long enough for your Arty to produce major damage and keep the enemy occupied long enough they can not get to their good set up spots after they deal with you.

<tr>
<th>PROS:</th>
<td>

Can throw the enemy so far off-balance they never recover.

Frequently leads to their Arty dying and the enemy causing damage to themselves.

Will often leave you laughing or smiling ear to ear. (Yeah, I know that isn't exactly a "PRO" for your team, but you DO play this game to have fun, right?)

Usable on every map.

</tr>
<tr>
<th>CONS:</th>
<td>

Not anywhere near as effective if you have 0-1 Arty on your team.

If the enemy successfully stops your infiltration, your team can end up down 3-4 tanks early on while suffering little to no damage in return.

You are all in from the get go and you will probably not survive past the first 2-3 minutes of the fight.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
<td>

As you infiltrate the enemy base, keep some separation between your Scout tanks.  Accidentally bumping each other and tracking yourselves is a surefire way to produce an epic fail. Remember, your goal is to infiltrate the enemy base and cause as much confusion and chaos as possible.

Once you get there, let your Arty do the glory work.  You need to concentrate on staying alive by weaving in and out of enemy tanks as long as possible.  Take snap shots when they present themselves but DO NOT STOP to gain an accurate shot.  Avoid ramming enemy tanks and take care not to ram each other.  Try to stay between enemy tanks so every shot they miss runs the risk of damaging their own team.

By the time the dust settles, the enemy team will often have lost numerous tanks and/or be so far out of position compared to your team that they will spend the rest of the fight on defense.

## Zone of Control (ZOC)


Certain areas on many maps hold great tactical importance.   Zone of Control (ZOC) areas offer good spotting and sniping once control is established.   The team which gains and maintains possession of a ZOC area frequently wins the battle.

Because of their tactical significance, ZOC fights often commence as soon as the battle begins on maps where these areas are easily accessible to both teams.  As Scout tanks are the fastest or among the fastest tanks on their team, they frequently participate in ZOC ops on these maps; attempting to establish and maintain control of the area until their slower, larger team mates arrive to solidify possession.

Areas where Scouts frequently engage in Zone of Control fights:

* The Central Hill in Mines Standard and Encounter modes.
* The Donut in Karelia Standard mode.
* The Abbey in Abbey.
* The Beach in El Halluf Standard and Encounter modes.
* The Hill in Himmelsdorf Standard and Encounter modes.

<table class='table'>
<tr>
<th>PROS:</th>
<td>

Possession of a ZOC are usually gives your team a huge advantage in the fight.

Most ZOCs offer great spotting and sniping locations.

Most ZOCs can also serve as outstanding launching points for delayed rushes or team assaults.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>CONS:</th>
<td>

If your team does not support you by closing off the entrance to the ZOC behind you, you can get over run by enemy quickly.

Firefights for possession of the entrance to the ZOC can trap you in the ZOC for much of the battle.

If the other team beats you to the ZOC you are often stranded out in the open with no good place to hide.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PRIME CONSIDERATIONS:</th>
<td>

If you are planning on beelining to a ZOC area in your battle, inform your team of your intentions during the 30 second countdown timer.   Remember to be polite.  It is much better to ask "Who will join me on the Hill?" than to command "All lights and mediums go to the Hill." People don't want to be told how to play but they are often willing to help those who ask.

Speed is often of the essence.  That means don't run over speed-eating trees, fences, buildings, etc.  Don't turn needlessly.   Stay as fast as possible!   If you can get there before the enemy and get set behind some cover, you have a huge advantage over the enemy still traversing the open entrance to the ZOC area.

As you deploy, keep an eye both on your team and the mini-map.   Are any team mates coming with you or setting up to support you?  Are any enemy sighted headed that way?   Do not be afraid to change your course and go elsewhere if no one is helping you out.

Getting there first is only part of the fight.  You still have to maintain control; something you probably can't do if you are alone and the enemy rushes 2-3 tanks.  Don't play the martyr and die defending an untenable position.  If you don't have the support you had hoped for and the enemy enters the ZOC in numbers which you can't handle, GET OUT!  Most ZOC areas have exfil paths which don't force you to fight your way back out the front door.  You are a Scout so be sneaky and exit stage left.  Take the back door down the cliff face, down the wall or whatever you need to do to escape alive.

Outnumbered or not, be prepared to fight.  The enemy is not going to deed you the WOT equivalent of a Park Place/Boardwalk combo without a fight.  If both teams get tanks into the ZOC area, fights are normally fast-paced, close quarters, and brutal.  It isn't time to day dream, kiss the spouse or be cute in chat.  By the time you finish typing "Are you ready to ruuuuuummmmmmmmmmmnble?" you could very well be dead

## Passive Spotting

Passive Spotting is the style most commonly used in the game today. Shot accuracy has been buffed to the point Suicide runs are no longer successful often enough to make them worthwhile. Most maps do not favor Half Court spotting. As a result, the benefits of covert spotting using passive techniques are favored on most maps by most Scouts.

Passive Spotting is a bit of a misnomer as Covert Spotting is more accurate (I prefer to call it "Ninja" Spotting). Passive means not actively taking a part in or not reacting to an action. Covert means secret, hidden, unseen. As we will see, Passive Spotting does require action on the Scout's part, but the Scout desires to remain unseen throughout. Despite "Covert" or "Ninja" being the better term, "Passive" is so ingrained in the psyche of WOT tankers, we stick with that term. But, whenever you hear the term "Passive Spotting", think "hidden"; it will keep your mind open to how to most effectively Passive Spot.

There are two main types of Passive Spotting: Bush and Open. Let's look at each individually, then talk about some general rules for Passive spotting.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Bush Passive</h3>

In Bush Passive, the Scout uses bushes or trees to hide his tank from the enemy while he keeps them lit up for his team. The addition of environmental camo bonuses allows the Scout to set up in what may become extremely close proximity to enemy tanks and remain undetected.

Ideally, one's entire tank is concealed however that is rarely possible. Trees won't provide 360 degrees of protection and most bushes won't either. Thus, one should set up in way which provides concealment from the angles most vulnerable to discovery. Monitor what is transpiring on the map and adjust your position as needed to remain concealed. Furthermore, in locations such as the east and west edges of Malinovka, Passive spotting frequently involves bush hopping; that is moving from 1 bush to the next, staying hidden while slowly reconnoitering the entire area. 

As I said, Passive spotting is NOT really passive; even if one never fires one's gun. Your goal is to remain HIDDEN, not to remain still.

Notice also, I said "bushes or trees". There are two ways to use trees. At times, the leaves of a tree will already provide concealment for you, usually because you are on terrain higher than the tree, but remember, you can also knock a tree down to create concealment on the ground right in front of you. Or maybe knock it down to the side of the bush you are in to provide lateral concealment.

There is a potential downside to knocking trees over for concealment. If you do it in a common Scout set up spot, an alert enemy may notice the knocked down tree, understand its implication, and blind fire into the tree or bush 

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Much safer than Active spotting; the enemy can't shoot what it can't see.
Allows your team to damage and destroy enemy tanks with little chance of them receiving return fire.

Environmental concealment allows spotting of enemy tanks at fairly close ranges.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Frequently takes your gun out of the game.

If no hard cover is quickly available, discovery often equals death.
If you guess wrong and no enemy shows up, you just wasted a few minutes of game time.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

If they provide the same view, a bush right next to a building or rock is better than a bush standing out in the open by itself. The ability to quickly get behind cover if spotted is life-saving.

Immediately after setting up in a bush, rotate your camera around and see if you are well hidden, especially from the direction you expect to see enemy tanks. Not being truly hidden is one of the most common mistakes Scouts make.
Remember that an enemy tank exposes you the instant he is 49m away, no matter whether he has Line of Sight or not.

<h3 class='no_toc'>Open Passive</h3>

Open Passive spotting does not use environmental camo; rather it relies on distance and superior View Range to provide concealment. It is especially effective against Heavys, Arty, and moving TDs. 
Once again, Passive is not really passive. Frequently one must move in order to maintain the separation required to remain concealed. Remember, when speaking about Spotting, "passive" really means "hidden".

Because distance is required, this technique is much more common on Open and Mixed maps, but if one remains aware of opportunity it can still be pulled off successfully at times on maps such as Himmelsdorf and Ensk. (I use it a lot at the start of games in Ensk).

<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th width='30%'>Pros:</th>
    <td>

Usable anywhere one has Line of Sight at the distance required.
Allows your team to damage and destroy enemy tanks with little chance of them receiving return fire.

Under the proper circumstances, usable on every map in the game.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cons:</th>
  <td>

Scout is normally extremely vulnerable if exposed.
Only usable in specific situations.

Requires intimate knowledge of View Ranges to maximize effectiveness.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prime Considerations:</th>
<td>

If a spotted tank has Binoculars and stops, its View Range can increase dramatically.

Because you are exposed, you must remain acutely aware of enemy tank locations on the map and adjust your position or abandon spotting before you are exposed.
KNOW the distance between you and spotted tanks. That means keep your reticle on them often enough to always have a current range to target displayed. This is NOT the time to guesstimate range.

Open Passive can often be combined with Sniping. (But have a good escape route ready.)

<h3 class='no_toc'>General Rules For Passive Spotting</h3>

During the countdown timer, tell your team you will light up tanks, then click on the map to show them where. This will alert them to where you will work; hopefully some will set up to take advantage of your spots.

Ex: *"Spots coming here:"*

Then click on 2-3 of the sectors where you will see the most tanks.

If possible, do not duplicate spots with another Passive Scout. It is much better to go elsewhere and light up a different area of the map than to park 2 bushes away from a Passive team mate and spot the same places he is.

Positioning your tank to so it points towards your escape route saves you precious seconds if you are exposed.

Eventually, the spots at your location will run out. Move on. It does your team no good if you sit in a location which has no tanks left to spot.

When multiple targets are it up, encourage focus fire by requesting fire on a specific tank.

Spend your "down time" doing Quick Counts, analyzing the positions of both teams on the battlefield, updating in your mind what you will do if exposed, and what you will when you stop Passive spotting.

Be aware of opportunities to Passive spot as the game progresses; it isn't just a thing you do when the game starts! Other tanks may get the glory, but it is almost always a better idea to get hidden, spot and let a distant ally get the damage and kill while you conserve hit points than it is to go Rambo and get beat up needlessly. The Hit Points you waste may prove critical later on.
