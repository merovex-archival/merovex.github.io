* **Bullet journal**: a method of journaling and note-taking that uses bullet points as the core structure
* **Index**: a table of contents that you update as you go
* **Daily Log**: stuff you did and/or need to do today (+ other observations)
* **Monthly Log**: traditional month calendar + stuff you need to do that month + stuff you forgot to do last month
* **Rapid Logging**: symbols that help you get that stuff done
* **Future Log**: year-at-a-glance calendar where you can put events, goals, and long-term stuff you need to do
