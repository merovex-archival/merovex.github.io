With a wake of failed missions, operative Jonaldy Ammonet is given a final chance in an organization where death is the only reward for failure. Recruiting the aid of Imperial Postal Marine Bophendze, Jonaldy saves a Dabrian imperial princess and her family from abduction only to find himself hunted with ruthless perfection by Creed Taneo, a living legend who wants his hostages back. Jonaldy must decide between the hostages and himself in order to stop interference with Dabrian imperial succession.
