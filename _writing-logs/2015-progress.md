This is my writing progress chart for Calendar 2015. If you've seen my [2014 progress chart](/writing-logs/2014-progress), you'll see this is my second year running. I got the idea from [Jamie Rubin's relentless tracking of his progress](http://www.jamierubin.net/2014/11/16/how-i-used-rescuetime-to-baseline-my-activity-in-2014-and-set-goals-for-2015/).

In 2014, my goal started at 150,000 words (or 150 kiloword/kword). I stepped the goal back to 124,000, which was the number required to finish the two drafts for *Luctatio* & *Imbroglio*. I'm setting a goal of writing an average of 100,000 words in 2015. That would finish a new novel, wrap up the edits on my two works-in-progress, and give me time to work on the next series.
