## Overview 

<!-- 3. Develop a mission statement. All businesses have one, and so should you. In other words, pinpoint what you are trying to achieve—and why. After all, it's not enough to bring a product to market; it also has to serve a purpose. -->

### Summary

This business plan summarizes the long-term approach Dausha Publishing seeks to take in self-publishing. The primary purpose is to develop multiple novel series for the purpose of glorifying God and empowering me to give more to his purpose through income replacement. 

Marketing will be largely passive, seeking to use Amazon's reach and customer delight to find the target audience. Prospective target readers conversion will be via the Amazon author and product pages, Facebook (to a lesser degree) and the Dausha Pulbishing website. Novels will use the popular self-publishing model that leverages Amazon's Audible, CreateSpace and Kindle platforms for purchases. Use of non-Amazon platforms seeks to drive the market to those platforms, largely by making the first book of a series free.

Customer engagement will be largely email-based, with some Facebook interaction. While Twitter is in use, it requires too much activity to be relied upon.

Dausha Publishing is largely solitary, with a team of advisors who provide spiritual guidance and feedback on the beta version of new books. Others help with the production of the final version.

### Organization

Due to lack of significant profit, Dausha Publishing is viewed by the IRS as a hobby. Eventually, earnings will exceed IRS' hobby criteria. At that point, Dausha Publishing will become an LLC.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

## Strategy

<!-- 7. Know how much time you'll need---and where to find it. All businesses take time to establish. Writing businesses are no exception. What is the minimum amount of time your project requires on a daily or weekly basis to keep it going? Multiply this out over the course of several weeks, months, or, if need be, years. Brainstorm ways to match and create additional pockets of time to keep your venture on track. -->

Strategy is provided via the [Writing a Novel Series](/w/writing-a-novel-series). The intent is to produce multiple novel series with an optimal length of eight novels. Each series should eight years to develop, write and publish. Series should overlap, such that there are essentially two series in production simultaneously.

Over the next 30 years, therefore, the goal is to produce four to eight novel series. The intent is to have the income equal to Author's day job equal, enabling him to become debt-free, help his children thrive and give to God's missions.

## Marketing and Sales

Marketing will be largely passive, seeking to use Amazon’s reach and customer delight to find the target audience. Prospective target readers conversion will be via the Amazon author and product pages, Facebook (to a lesser degree) and the Dausha Pulbishing website. Novels will use the popular self-publishing model that leverages Amazon’s Audible, CreateSpace and Kindle platforms for purchases. Use of non-Amazon platforms seeks to drive the market to those platforms, largely by making the first book of a series free.

### Marketing

This section provides a basic plan. I seek to follow [Randy Ingermanson's advice](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/blog/2012/11/21/defining-the-target-audience-for-your-fiction/) to market only to my Target Audience.

  </tr>
</table>

### Marketing Campaigns

**Reviewers.** Seek reviews via [The Indie Review](http://www.theindieview.com/indie-reviewers/) list. (See <a href='#team'>Team</a>)

**Novel Release Party.** A marketing campaign will be initated with each new novel release:

1. Email to Targeted Audience, based on subscribers to MailChimp email list.
2. Blog articles discussing series, characters or setting, which automatically feed to Facebook and Twitter.

**Chance Engagement.** Several blog articles will be posted throughout the year on various topics; hopefully of interest to the target audience. Published articles will automatically feed to Facebook and Twitter via [TwitterFeed](http://twitterfeed.com/).

### Sales Channels

As above, books are published both electronically and via hard-copy, as well as via audiobook. Distribution channels include:

### Pricing

Pricing below is based on the model offered by Amazon. Audiobooks have a variable cost based on the length of the audio, though due to the Audible Credits ($11 per), there is a floor. Kindle books are based on the fairly standard paradigm. ePub sales are notional, the purpose of which is to drive the price of the first series book down to promote the series for the target audience. Paperback sales are also notional for the purpose of promoting Kindle series.

The assumption is that 90-5% of sales will derive from Kindle sales, with the balance being audiobook.

## Team

<!-- 8. Create a board of advisors. All businesses need a core group of advisors (attorneys, CPAs, and the like) if they are to grow and prosper - and so do you. Your core group will have a different make-up, obviously; still, these are the folks you'll turn to for advice and encouragement. They don't all have to be writers, by the way. They should, however, support you in personal and professional ways, and hold you to a higher standard.

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* The legal form of ownership for your business.
* Who the leaders are in your business as well as their roles.
* The general flow of operations within the firm. -->

**Audio Production.** When it comes to audiobooks, there are essentially three approaches. You can self-narrate, hire a narrator on a flat-fee or hire a narrator via royalty sharing. Self-narration requires substantial investment in time, training and talent, of which I have none. The cost of narration based on my target book size is $2,000. This places the break-even at 500 sales, with the flat-fee having a higher unit cost for low sales volume, and the royalty sharing a higher cost at high sales volume. Until actual sales have validated the channel, Dausha Publishing follows the royalty-sharing model.

### Capital

None.

<!-- 
6. Determine how much money you will need. Every writing project requires some kind of expenditure, be it for file folders, travel, time off from work, etc. List your expenses and realistically ask yourself if you can afford to undertake your venture. If not, determine what you can do to cut a few corners, create a reserve, or "beg, borrow, or steal."

4. Identify what you have in start-up capital. What do you bring to the table as you launch your venture? Some items will be tangible (e.g., a computer, work space, financial reserve). Others will be intangible but critical nonetheless (e.g., key skills, and personal and professional experiences, etc.).

5. Identify what you do not yet have. Now that you know what start-up capital you have on hand, take a moment to pinpoint what you still need. Again, these things can be tangible or intangible. For example, you might need a workable writing space, a solid enough knowledge of your subject area, a ghostwriter, etc. Next, brainstorm ways to obtain each item you have listed. -->


<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

## Products

<!-- 
Understand your market and what you intend to provide. This is easy: produce a series of novel series. You will want to provide the theme, target audience and one-paragraph series summary for every series.

1. Identify your product. What do you intend to produce? A book, article, series of promotional pamphlets? A service by which you enrich, encourage, inform others through the written word? Be as specific in your description as you can. And while you're at it, give your product-to-be a working title.

2. Identify your customers. Who exactly are they? Men, women, children? Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs? Baby boomers, working women, recovering alcoholics? Where and how do they live? How old are they? What's their educational or financial level? Where do they stand politically, spiritually? What do they most need and want in their lives—and how can you, through your written product, deliver it? -->

This section describes the novel series developed for the purpose of this business. 

### Postal Marine Series

**Active 2011-2016.**

The **Postal Marine Series** is an 5-book Sci-fi dystopian set in a distant-future human autocracy. The primary purpose of this series is to teach myself how to develop and self-publish a fiction series.

**Target Audience: What fantasy am I creating/indulging in this series?**

The basic premise of PMS is that man is morally unchanged after 2,000 years, and aristocracy is the natural government of humanity. Bophendze experiences the brutality and corruption inherent in the system, and while he may hope to rail against it, he is but one man alone.
