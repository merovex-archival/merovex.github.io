I started Bellicose in 2012, after two other projects were stalled. I slowly worked my way to completion in 2013. After committing to only 500 words per day, I completed the draft on 21 January. You can see my [writing progress](/writing-progress-2014) as I continue. My next step is to pick up the *Luctation* draft and work it through to completion.
