Read Write Web recently issued an article discussing [Amazon's Short Story Collection](http://rww.to/eXcyKX), which targets the electronic publishing
medium. In a nutshell, this collection is defined as 5,000 to 30,000 words.
That's not a short story. According to [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/i0yODm) (source
of all true knowledge), a short story has a maximum word count of 7,000--9,000
words. So, has Amazon extended the size of the Short Story?

<!-- more -->

No. I submit what they're calling short stories are really  novellas. Novels
tend to start around 50,000 words (typically in the Western or Romance genre).
If short stories have a cap of around 8,000 words and novels start around 50,000
words, the gap is the novella.

The Kindle has propelled electronic reading, now that [electronic sales exceed
paper book sales](http://bit.ly/dM2Hlf). Authors are finding themselves a wider
audience in electronic publishing. I recently read about a man who was rejected
by 100 publishing houses, sold 10 paper copies, but now has sold thousands of
copies electronically.

My point? You now have the standard for novella lengths ala Amazon. Enjoy.
