In 2010, I wrote a pair of articles on copyright defense. The first was on [when you should copyright your work](/writing/when-should-you-register-your-work/). The follow-on article was about [how I protected my copyright](/writing/how-i-protect-my-copyright/). I wanted to offer a five-year retrospective. Below I advocate use of Git and Scrivener as a way of saving your work from loss or theft.

## Background Summary

To summarize a few legal points.

* Copyright occurs at point of creation (unless work-for-hire, etc.), (17 U.S.C. ยง 104)
* Unregistered copyright 
	*  requires the creator to demonstrate ownership, 
	*  allows courts to stop further publication of one's work (17 U.S.C. ยง 502&ndash;503),
* Registered copyright entitles a creator to:
	* a rebuttable presumption of creation due to the registration being *prima facie* evidence of copyright validity, (17 U.S.C. ยง 410&ndash;11)
	* monetary damages, criminal penalties, and provides a rebuttable presumption of creation,  (17 U.S.C. ยง 504&ndash;506)

I said before that Linus Torvalds demonstrated his creatorship of Linux by showing his versioning. In 2010, I had a naissant approach to managing copyright. I kept old versions of PDFs on hand, etc. I reread that article for this posting and was embarrassed.

## State of Things Since 2010

*Scintilla* was originally written in Scrivener, and was published in 2011. I did some work on *Bellicose* in 2012. I hit some roadblocks, fretted and fumed and blamed the tool instead of the craftsman.

In January 2013, I started using git to store the Postal Marine Series novel; using my own [Bookmaker toolchain](/technology/toolchain/), derived from [Kitabu](https://github.com/fnando/kitabu) (see the [Gem history](https://rubygems.org/gems/bookmaker/versions). The git repository for the novel series had 329 commits from January 2013 until November 2014. Then I changed to individual repositories for each novel.

In January 2015, I registered copyrights for my published works and have since had the certificates issued.

The September Scrivener update and [Jamie Rubin's recent article about GitHub](http://www.jamierubin.net/2015/12/22/tracking-the-things-i-make-with-github/) inspired me to give Scrivener another try. As such, I've ported my WIP and previously published works in the Postal Marine Series into Scrivener and committed that Scrivener to GitHub.

The big update here is that for the past three years I've used git repositories to track the evolutionary development of my works prior to copyright registration. Any work before that date of note was either ported into git, or registered. Jamie's article helped me realize I can continue to use git while using Scrivener. Why I had that mental blog befuddles me, but it was there.

What does 2016 hold? Scrivener in Git. I will try to post some on this in the coming year in my Technology thread.

## How Could Scrivener Help?

In 2010, I mention the value of showing evolutionary improvement. Traditionally this would work by having past copies of printed manuscripts and revisions. The author's file box. That's what Scrivener is today.

One of Scrivener's strengths is its ability to centralize all of an authors deliberative materials. Those character sketches, scene designs, background research, etc., can all be stored there. By combining that centralized storage with a third-party versioning tool like Git (on GitHub, BitBucket or other), the author is in a better position to provide evidence during a suit.

Will it be enough? Maybe. Consult with an attorney to have a better idea. As I said in 2010, we authors sometimes worry too much about our stories.

This is my approach as much because it also helps me avoid losing information to a computer death. My primary reason for using git is to offset the risk of losing countless hours of work.
