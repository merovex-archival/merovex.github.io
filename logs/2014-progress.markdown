This page helps to track my writing progress. I committed to 150,000 words in 2014. This page tracks my progress with the hope that it will help me be accountable. The data that drives the graphs is generated automatically each morning. I then have a couple manual scripts I have to run to pull that data and publish updates to this page.

**Update August 2014:** I set a goal of 150,000 words in 2014. However, the further I get through the year the more I realize the purpose of the goal was to finish two novels: *Luctation* and *Imbroglio*. Since I have good data from the beginning of the year, to finish both novels I needed to write 124,000 words. I was going to ignore the year objective, but now that I have momentum I wanted to use its gentle prod to continue forward. The caveat is that I've reset the goal to the 124,000 words necessary to meet the goal.
