        <h3 id='chart-wpd-title'>Words per Hour</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the amount of words per hour.
{%if page['year'] < 2016 %}
        This is based on the amount of time spent on my text editor (Sublime Text) and word count. Since I use Sublime for more than just novel writing and can't track that time discretely enough, some counts may be lower than actual. It's an inconsistency I can live with.
        {%else%}
 This is based on the amount of time spent on Scrivener, not all of that time would entail novel writing.

        <p>So far this year, I have written <span class='data' id='words-written'>billions</span> words during <span class='data' id='hours-written'>zillions</span> hours of writing.
