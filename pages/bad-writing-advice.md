## Overview

This page contains my desire to summarize all of the writing advice I impose on those around me who merely hint that they want to write. This is my Plank issue,[^plank] so I apologize if this is a Pearl issue as well.[^pearl] Throughout this summary page, I will try to incorporate relevant blog articles. I've read quite a lot of books, and what follows is what I think summarizes nicely what I've learned.

## My Tools

## Advice I Probably Should Listen To

### Three-Sentence Scene/Sequel Summary

Every **Scene** should have three sentences that summarize it. One restates the VP character's goal. The second discusses the scene's conflict. The third provides the disaster. (GCD)

**Sequel** likewise has three sentences. One gives the reaction to the previous scene. The second the dilemma; then finally a new goal. (RDG)

### One-Paragraph

* Each sentence needs to focus on one major thing, so think carefully about what your story is REALLY about.
* These sentences can be fairly long, but don’t get silly. You’re looking for sentences of 15 to 30 words. Don’t cheat and make a run-on sentence of 500 words. A summary is a SUMMARY.
* Yes, this is really hard work. It’s a rare writer who can make this stuff up in the heat of the moment, sweating in a chair across the table from a real live agent. You need to do this in advance.
* Set a timer and give yourself one hour to do this. An hour is plenty. If you can’t do it in an hour, then you can’t do it at all with the story you’ve got, and you’ll need to rethink things. Five minutes is too little. If you dash it out in five minutes, you probably aren’t done yet.

### Randy's Character Creation

Here are six questions that will get you rolling. Answer these questions for each of your main characters:

1. What is this character’s role in the story? (Hero or heroine, villain, sidekick, clown, friend-zone buddy, or whatever.)
1. What is this character’s name? (You can leave this blank if you’re desperate, but you’re going to need some sort of handle for this character, so I recommend that you pick something early and then change it later if you come up with a better one.)
1. What does this character want on Day 1 when the story opens? (This isn’t necessarily the main story goal. You’re looking for something that the character wants RIGHT NOW that will drive the story forward in the opening scene. This should be something specific and concrete that the character could conceivably get almost immediately.)
1. What keeps this character from getting what he or she wants? (Again, this isn’t necessarily the main obstacle in the story, but it’s the main obstacle in the first scene the character has a role in.)
1. In the bigger picture, what does this character want out of life? (This is probably going to be fairly abstract, but it might be concrete if the character has a very specific dream.)
1. What threatens to keep this character from ever having any chance of getting what she wants out of life? 

It’s easy to answer these questions for your hero or heroine. Most authors can quickly drill out the answers to all six questions for their protagonist.
It’s not so easy to answer them for your villain (if your story has a villain). That requires you to put yourself in the villain’s skin. To think like the villain. To empathize with the villain. And many people chafe at the idea of empathizing with a villain.

But if you don’t empathize with your villain, it’s very likely he’ll be a cardboard, uninteresting character. And if that happens, your story will very likely be thin.

It’s also easy to skimp on these questions for the lesser characters—the sidekicks and clowns in your story. But if you do this work, your story is going to become deeper. Because now your sidekick doesn’t exist solely to make your hero’s story come out well. Your sidekick now has his own story with his own goals, and those may come into conflict with your hero’s goals—even if they’re both the best of all friends.

## Twenty-Two Steps

### Develop Premise

* Premise: one-sentence summary of the book. "When action, character reacts, only to learn."
    1. **Wish/Premise List.** Visioning, Do a wish-list, compare to premise list and look for similarities
    2. **Possibilities** Find the promise, ask "what if?"
    3. **Story Problems/Challenges**
    3. **Designing Principle** (Strategy), the hook, schtick.
    4. **Best Character** identification
    5. **Central Conflict**
    6. **Critical Path** (Basic Action,  cause-and-effect pathway)
    7. **Character Change** Hero's Probably character change
        - W— weaknesses at the beginning: uptight, henpecked man
        - A— basic action: becomes involved with a gang of outlaws
        - C— changed person: gets a divorce
    9. **Moral Choice** Find Hero's Probable Moral Choice
    10. **Audience Appeal**


**Premise / Designing Principle in Exodus.** 

* **Premise** When an Egyptian prince discovers that he is a Hebrew, he leads his people out of slavery.
* **Designing Principle** A man who does not know who he is struggles to lead his people to freedom and receives the new moral laws that will define him and his people.
* **Theme Line** A man who takes responsibility for his people is rewarded by a vision of how to live by the word of God.

### Story

1. Weakness and need - psychological (hurting self) & moral (hurting others) need
2. Desire - Specific story goal
3. Opponent - Introduce someone seeking the same goal.
4. Plan - Something that addresses Desire and Opponent
5. Battle - Punch / Counter punch
6. Self-revelation - the psychological facade is stripped away and he sees himself as he really is
7. New equilibrium

### Moral Need

To give your character a moral as well as a psychological need and to make it the right one for your character, 

1. Begin with the psychological weakness. 
2. Figure out what kind of immoral action might naturally come out of that. 
3. Identify the deep-seated moral weakness and need that are the source of this action. 

A second technique for creating a good moral need is to push a strength so far that it becomes a weakness. The technique works like this:

1. Identify a virtue in your character. Then make him so passionate about it that it becomes oppressive.
2. Come up with a value the character believes in. Then find the negative version of that value.

#### SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 

* **Need** Hero John Miller must do his duty in spite of his fear (psychological and moral). 

* **Desire** He wants to find Private Ryan and bring him back alive.

### Characters

#### Story Roles

* Hero Clarice Starling
* Main Opponent Buffalo Bill, the serial killer
* Second Opponent Dr. Chilton, the warden
* Fake-Ally Opponent None
* Ally Jack, her boss at the FBI
* Fake-Opponent Ally Hannibal Lecter
* Subplot Character None

#### Archtype

* King Father
* Queen Mother
* Mentor
* Warrior
* Magician
* Trickster
* Artist / Clown
* Lover
* Rebel

Let’s look at how to execute this crucial technique. 

1. Begin by writing down what you think is the central moral problem of your story. If you worked through the techniques of the premise, you already know this.
2. Compare your hero and all other characters on these parameters:
    * weaknesses
    * need— both psychological and moral
    * desire
    * values
    * power, status, and ability
    * how each faces the central moral problem in the story 
3. When making these comparisons, start with the most important relationship in any story, that between the hero and the main opponent. In many ways, this opponent is the key to creating the story, because not only is he the most effective way of defining the hero, but he also shows you the secrets to creating a great character web.
4. After comparing the hero to the main opponent, compare the hero to the other opponents and then to the allies. Finally, compare the opponents and allies to one another.

Remember that each character should show us a different approach to the hero's central moral problem (variations on a theme).

### Characters as variations on theme

Here is the sequence for making this technique work: 

1. Look again at the final moral decision and your work on the premise line so you are clear about the central moral problem your hero must deal with in the story.
2. Make sure each of the major characters deals with the same moral problem, but in a different way.
3. Start by comparing the hero and the main opponent, since these characters personify the primary moral opposition you detail in the story. Then compare the hero to the other opponents.
4. Over the course of the story, each of the major characters should make a moral argument in dialog justifying what they do to reach the goal.

#### Levels of Desire

1. Survive (escape) 
2. Take revenge 
3. Win the battle 
4. Achieve something 
5. Explore a world

## Footnotes

[^plank]: In Matthew, Jesus tells the hypocrite to remove the plank from the hypocrite's eye before removing the speck from his brother's. The plank represents the hypocrite's desire to impose his will on the brother.

[^pearl]: Again in Matthew, Jesus describes the negative repercussions of throwing pearls to swine. This is not because you are swine, or that swine are bad. It's that the one giving advice smugly believes the receiver needs the advice and seeks to impose it upon them; ultimately leading to anger and resentment.
