## Overview

This page contains my desire to summarize all of the writing advice I impose on those around me who merely hint that they want to write. This is my Plank issue,[^plank] so I apologize if this is a Pearl issue as well.[^pearl] Throughout this summary page, I will try to incorporate relevant blog articles. I've read quite a lot of books, and what follows is what I think summarizes nicely what I've learned.

## Advice I Probably Should Listen To

### Three-Sentence Scene/Sequel Summary

Every **Scene** should have three sentences that summarize it. One restates the VP character's goal. The second discusses the scene's conflict. The third provides the disaster. (GCD)

**Sequel** likewise has three sentences. One gives the reaction to the previous scene. The second the dilemma; then finally a new goal. (RDG)

### One-Paragraph

* Each sentence needs to focus on one major thing, so think carefully about what your story is REALLY about.
* These sentences can be fairly long, but don’t get silly. You’re looking for sentences of 15 to 30 words. Don’t cheat and make a run-on sentence of 500 words. A summary is a SUMMARY.
* Yes, this is really hard work. It’s a rare writer who can make this stuff up in the heat of the moment, sweating in a chair across the table from a real live agent. You need to do this in advance.
* Set a timer and give yourself one hour to do this. An hour is plenty. If you can’t do it in an hour, then you can’t do it at all with the story you’ve got, and you’ll need to rethink things. Five minutes is too little. If you dash it out in five minutes, you probably aren’t done yet.

### Randy's Character Creation

Here are six questions that will get you rolling. Answer these questions for each of your main characters:

1. What is this character’s role in the story? (Hero or heroine, villain, sidekick, clown, friend-zone buddy, or whatever.)
1. What is this character’s name? (You can leave this blank if you’re desperate, but you’re going to need some sort of handle for this character, so I recommend that you pick something early and then change it later if you come up with a better one.)
1. What does this character want on Day 1 when the story opens? (This isn’t necessarily the main story goal. You’re looking for something that the character wants RIGHT NOW that will drive the story forward in the opening scene. This should be something specific and concrete that the character could conceivably get almost immediately.)
1. What keeps this character from getting what he or she wants? (Again, this isn’t necessarily the main obstacle in the story, but it’s the main obstacle in the first scene the character has a role in.)
1. In the bigger picture, what does this character want out of life? (This is probably going to be fairly abstract, but it might be concrete if the character has a very specific dream.)
1. What threatens to keep this character from ever having any chance of getting what she wants out of life? 

It’s easy to answer these questions for your hero or heroine. Most authors can quickly drill out the answers to all six questions for their protagonist.
It’s not so easy to answer them for your villain (if your story has a villain). That requires you to put yourself in the villain’s skin. To think like the villain. To empathize with the villain. And many people chafe at the idea of empathizing with a villain.

But if you don’t empathize with your villain, it’s very likely he’ll be a cardboard, uninteresting character. And if that happens, your story will very likely be thin.

It’s also easy to skimp on these questions for the lesser characters—the sidekicks and clowns in your story. But if you do this work, your story is going to become deeper. Because now your sidekick doesn’t exist solely to make your hero’s story come out well. Your sidekick now has his own story with his own goals, and those may come into conflict with your hero’s goals—even if they’re both the best of all friends.



## Footnotes

[^plank]: In Matthew, Jesus tells the hypocrite to remove the plank from the hypocrite's eye before removing the speck from his brother's. The plank represents the hypocrite's desire to impose his will on the brother.

[^pearl]: Again in Matthew, Jesus describes the negative repercussions of throwing pearls to swine. This is not because you are swine, or that swine are bad. It's that the one giving advice smugly believes the receiver needs the advice and seeks to impose it upon them; ultimately leading to anger and resentment.
