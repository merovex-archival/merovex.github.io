## Overview

This page contains my desire to summarize all of the writing advice I impose on those around me who merely hint that they want to write. This is my Plank issue,[^plank] so I apologize if this is a Pearl issue as well.[^pearl] Throughout this summary page, I will try to incorporate relevant blog articles. I've read quite a lot of books, and what follows is what I think summarizes nicely what I've learned.

[^plank]: In Matthew, Jesus tells the hypocrite to remove the plank from the hypocrite's eye before removing the speck from his brother's. The plank represents the hypocrite's desire to impose his will on the brother.

[^pearl]: Again in Matthew, Jesus describes the negative repercussions of throwing pearls to swine. This is not because you are swine, or that swine are bad. It's that the one giving advice smugly believes the receiver needs the advice and seeks to impose it upon them; ultimately leading to anger and resentment.
