**Updated 2016.** This Advanced Base Guide focuses on base specialization and location. It is ideal for players who are planning to play free accounts, but should be of use for any player. If you find an area confusing, I can be reached via my [Facebook Fan page](http://on.fb.me/1M3gSiz).

## Astro Layout

The three major areas of activity on a base are: fleet production, research, and commerce.

Because space is a premium on all astros, it is critical that you build your empire by specializing your astros. All bases should have the same minimum infrastructure. Specialization helps a given base reach its potential. This section discusses basic empire organization and specific base structures. 

### Basic Empire Organization

For a basic empire, you will want three Commerce[^Commerce] astros, two Research Astros, three Production astros, and a balance of Production/Research astros (dual-purpose).  Your first will likely be a dual Production/Research base. This arrangement provides ten bases---the goal of [Seven/Ten Guide].

When building your initial empire, your second, third and fourth bases should be commerce specialized to help jump start your economy. The table below suggests an order in which you may build your bases.

[^Commerce]: Most guides call these &#8220;economy&#8221; astros. I prefer to call the &#8220;commerce&#8221; because I have a symbol for commerce I use.

<div class='alert alert-danger' >
Commerce bases are of dubious value. Consider building them up briefly
in the beginning, then converting them to Production bases.

**Why is your first base a dual-purpose base?**  In the [Seven/Ten Guide], I advised you to start with a Rocky, Crater or Metallic
planet; to optimize production. These three astros are suited for
Production, yet you have to build eight Research Labs to expand your
bases. Rather than later disband those Labs (recovering only half of
what you spent), the recommendation is that you make your first base
dual-purpose.

### Base Structure Goals

Earlier, I said that all bases have a minimum infrastructure. The table below shares that build list. I also provide build lists for Research, Production, and Commerce bases.

The minimum layout in the table below shows the basic structure that
should work for all free players. It's a good goal for upgraded players
as well, until you need to grow beyond its offerings. The [Production Structures] are balanced for cost to ensure you are always building the most economical base.

The goals listed here are easily possible for a player under Level 30.
These goals allow a player to build the key infrastructure for a base
without heavy research requirements. Orbital Bases, Androids Factories,
Antimatter Plants and Multi-Level Platforms all require substantial
research to construct. These &#8220;[Very Advanced Structures](#very)&#8221; are discussed below.

* **Urban:** Assumes a Slot-2 Arid, Tundra or Rocky. Divide the Total by your astro's fertility and round up.
*  **Shipyards:** Level 12 allows Heavy Cruisers, which helps ensure all bases have a 2:1 (CR:HC) ratio.
*  **Command Centers:** Level 10 improves defenses 50 percent.
*  **Base Econ:** You should assume an increase of 25 percent above base economy per Trade Route. So, the Minimal base should have an effective economy of 140.

<div class='alert alert-danger' >

I still need to redo the Upgraded column.

<div class='alert alert-info' >

Total = structures + ceil(structures/fertility) + ceil(structures/energy)
</div>

Arid and Tundra type planets have 95 available spaces, 120 spaces
with Terraform, and 170 with Multi-level Platforms. Rocky has 85, 110
and 160, respectively.
Crystals have 80, 105 and 155.
Asteroids have 65, 90 and 140.

The **Minimum column** below represents the structure limits free players experience. The energy requirement for the minimum layout is 75, which requires Fusion-10 (assuming Energy-20).
Disrupter Turret-3 raises the requirement to 99, which requires Fusion-13.
With a Slot-2 Arid or Rocky, the base will need Urban-13, Urban-15 if a Crystal or Asteroid.
With this example, the base will consume 87 of the astro's available
spaces, which is within the limits of even the fully-Terraformed
Asteroid. Adding the other four Shipyards (needed for Battleships) on an
Asteroid would require Urban-16, but no new Fusion Plants. This adds
five slots, which is just outside the limits of a
Terraformed Asteroid.[^2]

[^2]: The ready solution is to drop two Robotic Factories from the goal, which gives the space required.

The **Research column** represents the minimum build with 22 Research Labs.
This is enough for Cybernetics, but not enough for Tachyon. You need the
Cybernetics for improved productivity, but not the Tachyon. The number
of Spaceports is reduced because of space limits for a Terraformed
Slot-2 Arid planet require saving seven spaces, which is gained by
reducing the number of Spaceports <em>or</em> Robotic Factories.

The **Production column** represents the optimal infrastructure for a Fully
Terraformed (for a free player) Slot-2 Rocky Planet. Of the 110 available slots, every one
is filled, assuming Energy-20 with only Fusion Plants. Notice the
reduced number of Robotic Factories; saving energy and space.

The **Commerce column** assumes a Slot-2 Crystal optimized. These are
extremely rare, which helps underscore why Crystals are **more hype than value**. In reality, a player is better served with a Slot-2 Rocky with
Spaceport-20 than with a Crystal base. The added economy and trade route is worth 30 credits,
which is more than adding the Crystal Mines. The Real Economy row shows
in parenthesis the potential value of a Slot-2 Rocky with Spaceport-20
(based on the quality of your empire's Trade Routes.)

## Astro Choice

Base location is a critical concern for a successful empire. Remember
the real estate mantra: &#8220;Location, location, location.&#8221; This section discusses the three considerations in astro selection.

### Astro Specialization and Type

These are good pros and cons for each type of astro. The
general consensus for astro choices are the following:

Each astro has different advantages that make them better for certain
specializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize
the astros below. If the astro is not below, do not waste your time. The
emboldened astro is the preferred choice for a given specialization.

<div class='alert alert-info' >

I recommend Asteroids over Crystals because you can convert the Roid
base to a Production base when you've sobered up. &#8220;Commerce&#8221; bases do
not provide the long-term value you seek in a strong empire.
</div>

My findings vary a bit from the sage wisdom of other guides. I did
separate analysis of slot usage below. The
analysis was never completed as I started working on my scout database.
However, I stand by my recommendations. If you do not see an astro
listed above, *avoid* it.

## Natural

The table below is from the Astro Empires tables list. This is to help
guide your understanding regarding why certain astros are preferred for
bases. Production planets need more Metal. Commerce planets need more
Crystals, and Research planets need more area and fertility.

The red figures above are the characteristics of the astro type that
make that astro appealing. When astro hunting, always make a note of
Crystalline, Gaia and Rocky astros. If you do not plant a base there,
somebody will. There are a lot of Asteroids, otherwise I would recommend
charting them, too.

Free account players should add 25 to the astro's area to represent the
maximum possible space they will have available with terraforming. Once
you research Armour-22, you should add another 50 to the astro's area to
represent the limits you will encounter with Multilevel Platforms. Thus,
an Asteroid will never have more than 140 spaces for structures.

### Astro Orbit Preferences

<div class='alert alert-warning' >
Prefer Metal-3, Slot-2 astros. Planets if you need space, moons and roids if you want cheap prings.
</div>

**Choose Slot Twoes.** Naturally, you will let your needs influence your decision on which astro to take.
When you can be choosy, prefer a Slot 2 orbit (e.g.  GXX:XX:XX:**2**X).
Slot 2 orbits have 3 solar energy, which provides cheap,
accessible energy.[^3]
Slot 2 orbits also increase base Fertility by one, which reduces the
infrastructure you need to build your base.[^4]
This easy access to cheap energy and improved fertility is what makes Slot 2 orbits preferable.


**Slot 1 orbits are the second preference** because they have higher solar
energy but less fertility.[^5]

Slot 3 and beyond are terrible choices as you are always in a deficit in
either energy or fertility. The exception is Toxic in Slot 4 or Slot 5.
This is because Gas is better and mitigates problems with lower
fertility. You may chose a Slot-3 if you can afford the extra Fusion
plants you will have to build to offset the low solar output. You still
get the Slot-2 fertility benefit.


[^3]: When your Energy research gets to level 20, you will be pulling 6 energy from Solar Plants. They are also cheaper than Fusion Plants, which should allow you to absorb the minor loss in space.

[^4]: Slot 3 orbits also have a boost to fertility, but the loss in solar energy (2 instead of 3) makes Slot 3 a poor choice

[^5]: The trade-off may not be aparent at first.  When you research Energy-3, your Solar Plants will produce one more energy.  This means energy deficits are easier to remedy than population deficits, which makes Slot 2 the better choice.

### Choosing a Planet, Moon or Asteroid

<div class='alert alert-info' >
Planets if free account player, 
Moons if upgraded,
Astroids if you're patient.
</div>

**Should you choose a moon or a planet?** If you are going to play with a
free account, you should focus on planets. Otherwise, you should focus
on moons. This is because of limitations of space. Free players are
limited to five terraform structures. This puts a ceiling on the number
of structures they can build. Therefore, free players need the larger
astros to maximize what they can build.

Conversely, upgraded players have no ceiling on structures. This allows
paying characters to focus on other issues; such as cost.  Deflection
Shields, Planetary Shields and Planetary Rings cost 25 percent less on
Moons than Planets. That is a gross savings of 1024, 6250 and 12500
credits, respectively. The size difference between a Moon and Planet is
usually surmounted by two Terraforming, which costs 192 credits. Thus,
it is cheaper to occupy Moons in the long term for upgraded players.

At least, this is the traditional logic. I need to look into this
further to determine if there is real cost savings.

Of course, if you focus on planets, you will pay full price for Prings
and Pshields. Moons cost half as much, and asteroids a quarter as much.

<h2 id='very'>Very Advanced Structures</h2>

Orbital Bases, Androids Factories, Antimatter Plants and Multi-Level
Platforms all require substantial research to construct. The Advanced
Base Guide offers [build goals](#buildgoals) for free
players. That is, it shows what a player limited to five terraforms can
accomplish by building on the right astro.  Those goals provide a free
player with all the structures necessary to have a thriving empire.

I was asked to touch on what I call &#8220;Very Advanced Structures.&#8221; As
earlier, I will discuss these structures for the benefit of free
players. I term them &#8220;Very Advanced&#8221; to sub-categorize these from the
Advanced Structures that Astro Empires has.  Advanced Structures are
those structures that Astro Empires limits a free player from building.
Those structures discussed in the **Advanced Base Guide** are essential
for a free player to have any real longevity in Astro Empires.

Very Advanced Structures are important as a player grows beyond Level 30. I separated them because you really cannot use these structures
until you have the sound foundation offered through the Advanced Base
Guide.

## Advice on Structure Use

This section discusses the Very Advanced Structures and how they can be
best used for a Free Player.

### Multi-Level Platforms and Orbital Bases

When available, these two structures should be built to their limit.
Orbital Bases provides berths for 50 spaces.
One might consider this a way to reduce the space used by Urban Structures.
However, Multi-Level Platforms (MLP) provide 50 spaces.
Therefore, rather than using Orbital Bases to free up space on an astro,
these structures work with Multi-Level Platforms to provide the base
with 50 available spaces.

### Antimatter Plants Do Not Free Up Fusion Plants

One might expect that the Antimatter Plants would help free up space on
the astro by reducing the need for Fusion Plants. After all, at
Energy-20, an Antimatter Plant provides 20 units of energy. Five Plants
would free up 12 Fusion Plants, which only provides the base with seven
extra slots. There is a better use for these Plants than freeing up
seven slots discussed in the following sub-section.

### Three Pringles is Enough

Pringles is the vernacular for a pair of Planetary Rings and Shields. At
Level-30, players are well advised to have at least one set of Pringles
on each base. Two is considered minimal. I would recommend three. Three
sets of Pringles requires 108 energy, which consumes all the available
Antimatter Plants a free player has at his disposal, and requires a
Fusion Plant. Assuming the free player builds the MLP and Orbital Bases
as described above, <strong>three sets of Pringles require 9 spaces</strong> on the
Astro: none for the Rings, three for the Shields, five for the
Antimatter Plants, and one for the Fusion Plant. It would also consume
12 of the 50 berths provided by the Orbital Bases.

A fourth set would require additional 5 Fusion Plants, consuming 6
spaces on the astro and 7 berths. Therefore, from a space and resource
utilization perspective, a fourth set consumes fifty percent more resources than the first three; energy excluded.

### Android Factories

Android Factories are also very useful. All five factories provide 30
construction and production. They require three Fusion Plants, and consume
eight berths on the Orbital Bases and eight spaces on the astro.

### Orbital Shipyards

Are Orbital Shipyards essential? I include them in this discussion
because they require advanced research. Astro Empires does not limit the
free player in building these structures. Why? Because these structures
allow a player to build the Capital ships, and you need seven to build a
Death Star.

I champion the [Small Fleet Doctrine]. That Doctrine holds that
Capital ships are unnecessary.  The only possible exception is the
production of Dreadnaughts, which work well with Planetary Rings in
making a base an inefficient target.  However, a few Battleships
accomplish the same task while complying with the Doctrine. Therefore,
if you comply dogmatically to this Doctrine, you may not need an Orbital
Shipyard.

A reader once asserted the paragraph above was a bit short-sighted.  After
all, an Orbital Shipyard takes up no space. It draws 12 energy and a
single berth. If you are using Fusion Plants to power it, then three
total berths are consumed, with four energy remaining; or two of them
consume 5 total berths. An Orbital Shipyard provides an additional 9
production (remember it requires Cybernetics-2, which boosts baseline
production), which would require five spaces, and a Fusion Plant;
consuming 6 berths. Two Orbital Shipyards, consuming five berths,
provide as much production as 9 Shipyards, which requires 11 slots and
berths.

This taken into account, there is value in building Orbital Shipyards
for the sole purpose of boosting Production. You should let your total
plan for a base guide you.

### Biosphere Modification: Too Little, Too Late

Biosphere Modification is similar to Orbital Shipyards as Astro Empires
does not limit its construction by Free Players.  This only affects
Urban Structures, however, as Orbital Bases are not affected by an
astro's fertility. Is this a big deal? I contend they are not.

For a Slot-2 Arid fully Terraformed, one level of Biosphere Modification
frees two or three Urban Structures at most. Arid<sub>2</sub> astros have a Fertility
of 6. A Minimal base has Urban Structures-12, with the Research bases
having Urban Structures-17; providing berths for 60 and 102 spaces,
respectively. Raising the Fertility to 7 means those Structures provide
72 and 119 berths.

As discussed above, Orbital Bases work with Multi-Level Platforms.
Therefore, extending the Fertility does not impact the additional space
offered by MLPs. Therefore, the Modification lets the base owner retire
extra Urban Structures. Now, the Research base only needs Urban
Structures-15, which frees up <strong><em>two</em></strong> Structures. At Biosphere
Modification-2, the astro now needs Urban Structures-13. Bioshpere
Modification-3 means that base now needs Urban Structures-12! Three
modifications on a Fertility-6 astro allows you to free up five slots.

The first level costs 20,000 credits. As I don't have the cost of higher
levels, each next level should cost 50 percent more than the last. So,
Level-2 costs 30,000, and the Level-3 costs 45,000.  For a total
expenditure of 95,000 credits, a free player can retire five Urban
Structures---a cost of 19,000 per Structure retired.

## Build Suggestions

Let us assume you've followed the suggestion of this guide. You, the
free player, have built three sets of Pringles and maxed out the
Androids Factories. This consumes 17 spaces on the Astro---two MLPs.
This consumes the power generated by all five of your Antimatter Plants
and four Fusion Plants. This table below summarizes the impact of these
building decisions, but reflects that you have a 42 spaces remaining, 39
berths and four energy.

<div class='alert alert-info' >

Let me let you in on a bit of a secret. How many Urban Structures are
needed to berth an astro? The answer is number of slots available
divided by one more than the fertility:

US = Available / (Fertility + 1)

This is because the Urban Structures themselves consume a space. Try it!
</div>

What do we do with the remaining spaces? You can (for the space):

* (25) Make a Production base a full Production/Research base. Building Labs-22 consumes 25 spaces and berths after including the energy.
* (2) Add Jumpgates, which requires one Fusion Plant and consumes 2 berths and spaces per level. By adding one Urban Structure, you can add JG-3 to any base.
* (11) Increase to Command Center-20, costing 11 berths and requiring one Fusion Plant.
* (6-12) Increase to Spaceport-20, costing 5-10 berths and 1 or two Fusion Plants
* (12) Increase your Metal Refinery and Robotics Factories to 22 and 18 respectively, which &#8220;balances&#8221; these structures with the Androids Factories-5 and consumes 12 more energy and berths (one more Fusion Plant after the Remaining above), and increases your base economy by 12 (to 60 based on your trade routes).

## Final Observation

I offer a suggestion for free players. It costs 3 USD per month to
upgrade an account. If you really want to get more from this game, then
maximize your construction of all the limited strucutres; build your
Pringles and fully develop the bases within the limits of your free
account. Save as many credits as you can.  Then, upgrade for one month
and spend every spare moment of that month building the structures
beyond the limits. Build Terraform-10, Nanite-11, etc.

Better yet, <strong>build more bases</strong>. By growing from 9 to 10 bases, you
increase your empire's potential by 11 percent. For each additional
base, the returns diminish; the percentage return is 20 minus the number
of bases. So, from 9 to 10 bases, you have an 11 percent return; 10 to
11 has ten percent; 11 to 12 has 9 percent, etc. Spending a month to
build from 9 to 12 bases, however, increases your empire by 30 percent.
Is that worth 3 USD? Having the money saved and Outpost Ships ready at
the beginning of the paid-for month is the best way to maximize your
&#8220;Free&#8221; empire's potential.

<div class='warn' >

Under revision I'm working my way from top to bottom. The net
conclusions are the same, the supporting data is skewed.
</div>
<h2 id='toc1'>Assumptions</h2>

My analysis makes the following assumptions. This analysis assumes a
moderately advanced account, which I believe helps newer accounts plan
what they will need for space planning a few months out.

* Energy-20 (i.e., double energy output)
* Free account limitations (Five of the following: Terraform, Fusion Plants, Antimatter Plants, Nanite Factories, Android Factories.)
* Good defenses comprise Pring-15, Pshield-10, and CC-5.

Following these assumptions, we know:

* Astro area is increased by 25 for the Terraforms.
* Advanced Plants consume 10 spaces and berths, and provide 200 energy
* Advanced Factories consume 10 spaces and berths, and 60 energy
* Good defenses consume 7 spaces, 10 berths, and 109 energy
* Net difference is -2 spaces, -30 berths and +31 energy

Why does this matter? Beyond these &#8220;constants,&#8221; we have to consider
Spaceports, Shipyards, Labs and construction infrastructure. Small Fleet
encourages 12 to 16 Shipyards per base (you'll need Dreads for base
defense, which is 20 Shipyards and an Orbital Shipyard).

Terms Used
* <strong>Slot</strong> is the orbit of an astro.
* <strong>Berth</strong> is a unit of population consumed.
* <strong>Space</strong> is a unit of astro area consumed.

## Analysis for This Guide

### Space Available

The tables below show the amount of space available after applying the
assumptions above. Two spaces have been removed due to less space. The
bonus in energy and loss in berths are assumed to balance out...so I'm
leaving them out. In reality, the energy bonus benefits Slot-2 astros
across the board by mitigating the difference in lost solar power.

The &#8220;U&#8221; shows the number of Urbans required. The &#8220;P&#8221; shows the number of
Solar (or Gas) Plants. The fourth column (Slot-2,3(F)) denotes only
fusion plants, which is available to Upgraded players in sufficient numbers and conveys the
benefit of increased fertility without the loss of Solar.

#### Planets

Free players should select Planets because of the added space. I suggest
spending a bit of money to upgrade your account for one month and
building two extra Terraforms on Moons instead, which will give you the
general low cost of a Free account with the cost advantage of moons and
the space of planets.

As with Moons, the available space difference between Slot 1 and Slot 2
is again slight; but Slot 2 is preferred. As with Moons, Metallic astros
bear the greatest difference. This is due largely to their normal
Fertility and size.

</table>

The general advice has been to take a Slot 1 over Slot 2 moon. This is
because of the increased Energy of the Slot 1. However, the table
reveals the difference to be slight to non-existant. In the case of
Metal-3 astros, the preference should be Slot-2.

If you eventually replace all Solar Plants with Fusion, you will only
gain two spaces, limiting the value of Fusion Plants when considered
with their cost.  Because the Fusion Plant column assumes unlimited
upgrades, the value of an all-Fusion planet is not available to free
players. This is an issue for Moons and Planets.

Arid and Tundras are generally preferred as research bases, and they are
slightly larger than Gaias. This means Gaias are not the holy grail that
is widely touted. Toxic Moons compete with Earthly, which means they
should be considered when in Slot 4 and 5.

### Base Defenses

Good Astro Defense includes:

* 3 x Planetary Rings
* 2 x Planetary Shields

Because Rings do not take up space on the astro, this consumes 2 slots.
As <abbr title='Planetary Rings'>prings</abbr> require 24 energy, and <abbr title='Planetary Shields'>pshield</abbr> require 16 energy, these defenses require 104
Energy, which requires six Antimatter Plants. Therefore, we have 11
structures requiring population.  So, when determining what you put on a
base, consider the impact of defenses. (+16 energy, -11 slots)

Add to that a 10 recommended Command Centers (-10 energy, -10 slots).
The actual number of Command Centers depends on your situation.
Combined Astro Defenses and Command Centers (+6 energy, -21 slots).

The following is the impact of the Good Astro Defense with Command
Centers on **planetary** slots.

The above table assumes the astro is optimized for Production. Following
the Efficient Fleet model, we would only build 12 Shipyards. However,
for those who want to build Dreads, we include that calculation as well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This is an FAQ for the Advanced Base Guide. The goal of that guide is to offer novice players a bit of experienced wisdom. It also challenges more experienced players who have not given optimal base design serious thought. This FAQ page tries to address some lingering questions to that guide that falls outside its scope.

<p class='lead'>Why does the Research Column mention a reduced number of Spaceports?</p>

Free players are limited in the number of Terraforms. The Research Labs increase the total number of spaces needed by 29 when the Fusion Plants and Urban structures are built. This puts an Arid astro with five Terraforms over its space allocation by five. The two ways to remedy this is to eithe reduce the number of Robotic Factories or Spaceports by five. This saves the need for one Urban and one Plant, totaling seven. The Production column demonstrates the reduction by Robotic Factories.

<p class='lead'>What about Android Factories? Don't Free players get five of them as well?</p>

Free players get five Android Factories, which increase the energy demands by 20. This would require three more Fusion Plants and four more Urban Structures. This is a total space demand increase of 12 spaces for a production/construction improvement of 30. The [Production Structures] page shows the baseline construction for a Minimum base of 76, so this is an improvement of fifty percent. However, by researching to Cybernetics-10, a free player gains the same improvement without the increased space demands.
