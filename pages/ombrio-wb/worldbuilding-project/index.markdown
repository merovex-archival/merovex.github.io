## Greetings

If you've found this page, then you are at least curious about my request for worldbuilders. I'm hoping to put together a few fantasy/sci-fi fans who want to be a little creative and help put together a shared world.

I've done this before, about a decade ago with the [Everyspace Society project](http://www.espacesociety.org/macropedia/imperium-edition). Everyspace started as an attempt to world build for the [Fudge role-playing game](http://www.fudgerpg.com/). Everyspace did not result in the sort of shared world I had hoped for, though working in that setting helped me to conceptualize the Imperium.

## Objective

The **Ombrio Worldbuilding Project** (hereafter, OWP or Project) is an effort to develop a slipstream genre[^slipstream] milieu via community. It was founded by Benjamin Wilson as a way to help flesh out the milieu. He saw this as a chance to encourage other writers to share a milieu. Delusions of grandeur assert that a project like this could yield a universe as rich as Star Wars, Star Trek and other cult-followed. All it lacks is content...and a cult.

## Mechanics

This section will provide the underlying mechanics of how the game is run.

### The Lexicon Game

As with Everyspace, the primary approach will be the via [Lexicon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon_%28game%29). The concept is the team members are opinionated scholars documenting the fictional world in which they live.

Lexicon is a turn-based game, with each member responsible for drafting one or more entries per week.

<blockquote><p>In a turn, each player writes one entry that begins with the turn's specified letter. If one or more undefined entries are available that begin with the letter, a player must choose and write an undefined entry before any new entries can be created under that letter. A new entry must create and link to two undefined entries, and must also link to an entry written on a previous turn. Near the endgame, when sufficient undefined entries exist to occupy all players for the remainder of the game, no new undefined entries may be created.</p>

### Copyright & License

To simplify copyright and due to the need to contract, team members should be citizens of the United States and eighteen or older. Beyond that, the intent is to release the **Ombrio Worldbuilding Encyclopedia** as Creative Commons ([CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)). This allows anybody to reuse, publish, or create other works based off of the content of the encyclopedia. Consider this a shared milieu for authors and gamers.

By participating, each team member agrees to abide by these terms. They also assert they have the right to contribute the information they provide in their entries.

Since Ben is an self-described author, he commits to provide team members with one free paperback of any novel he publishes as consideration for others participation. He also commits to including an Acknowledgment for each team member in anything related to the **Ombrio Worldbuilding Project**.

CC BY 4.0 requires attribution[^cc-attribution]. To honor that requirement, we ask authors include the following reference in their copyright page:

{:block: class="alert alert-success" }
This work features content from the &ldquo;Ombrio Worldbuilding Project,&rdquo; available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

**Note:** URL for linking to **Ombrio Worldbuilding Project** will follow at a later date.

### Marketing

The team's primary means of communication will be via Facebook page. I've used Google Group before with some success, but recognize that Facebook has its own benefits. Among those benefits is marketing the project.

### Project / Team Communication

The Project Facebook page is the primary communications tool. As **Ombrio Worldbuilding Project** will be managed on Github, see below, other project-specific communication can be managed there. Github provides issue tracking, a project-specific wiki, and other tools. I like [Ben Balter's rules for team communication](http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/).

#### Issue Management

Via Github, more to follow.

#### Chat?

(Consider using [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) for interactive project communication.[^gitter]

### Entry Submission

**Github.** The **[Ombrio Worldbuilding Project](https://github.com/dausha-publishing/Ombrio-Worldbuilding-Project)** content will be maintained via [Github](http://github.com) repository using the [Dausha Publishing organization](https://github.com/dausha-publishing) to manage permissions. Github provides tracability and allows each team member to maintain a fork of the encyclopedia.

Since Github allows direct submission, it is possible for a team member to directly enter content there. Or, the team member may opt to maintain a local copy of the project and edit locally. We recommend the local method as it ensures each team member has a full working copy of the Project content.

**Markdown/kramdown.** Entries will be written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), or more specifically, [kramdown-parsable Markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). Each entry are subject to edit by one of the editors (assuming more than one), though in theory anybody can edit.

**Propriety.** To keep the availability of the content, entries should avoid anything graphic or obscene...keep it family friendly.

### Encyclopedia Publication

Ben Wilson will publish the encyclopedia on a website for public consumption throughout the project life-cycle. Depending on input from the team members, he may also publish the completed encyclopedia via electronic and print media (i.e. Kindle and Paperback).
