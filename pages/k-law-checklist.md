0. UCC or Restatements?

1. Contract Formation
    "K is promises 2) where law 3) remedies breech, or 4) recognizes performance as
    duty." (R2K 1)
    1. Was there mutual assent -- Offer and Acceptance
    2. Was there consideration
    3. Are there any defenses?

    A. Manifestations of Assent 
        1. Mutual Assent
        "Mutual assent requires parties exchange of a promise or begin or render
        a performance" R2K 18

        2. Intent to be Legally Bound
        "Neither real nor apparent intention that a promise be legally binding is essential to the Formation of K, but Manifestations of intent that promise shall not affect legal relationship may not prevent the Formation of K." R2K 21

    B. Offer
    "Offer exists when 1) A communicates 2) intent to bargain 3) to B, 4)
    inviting acceptance and 5) acceptance creates K w/o further approval."
    R2K 24
        1. To Whom Offer is Addressed
        "A's manifest intent determines party(s) who have PoA." R2K 29(1)

        2. Opx K
        "An Opx K is a promise to keep an offer open for stated period of time
        that limits A's ability to revoke."

        3. Preliminary Negox
        "a Manifestations of willingness to enter bargain !offer if B knows/reas. to
        know that A !intend to conclude bargain until he has made further
        Manifestations of assent." R2K 26
            a. "A bound only IAW manifested assent;"
            b. "may be bound if he has RM of knowing appearance of assent."

        4. Firm Offer UCC 2-205
            a. w/ statement:
                (1) B's form: irrevocable if spec. signed by A

            b. w/o statement: "reasonable time or <= 3 mths.
            c. buy/sell goods irrevocable if signed & explicit assurance
            d. Revocation by A
                (1) effective upon receipt
                (2) lost offer NEVER becomes effective
                (3) rec'd when A/authorized agent receives.
                (4) UCC: virtually same test UCC 1-202(e)
                (5) indirect: B behaves inconsistent w/ intent to K
                (6) !revoked when B learns A in nego. w/ T.
                (7) !revoked if B !learns A inconsistent.
                (8) offer in general pub. revoked by same pub.
            e. death/incapacity of either party R2K 48
                (a) !revoked if opx K; unless dead P makes impossible to
                perform.
            f. Change in legality voids offer.
            g. "Firm Offer" UCC 2-205

        5. Offer Revocation
            a. Pre-Acceptance Reliance (Limiting Revocation)
            b. Part-performance or Detrimental Reliance: Temporary Irrevokability
                (1) A's acceptance of Consideration for promise to keep offer open.
                (2) Opx is hybrid: both K and offer.
                (3) Unclear Uni-/Bi-K (B can chose promise/perform) (R2K 62)
                    "When in doubt B can either promise/perform." R2K 32
                    (a) B can pick either.
                    (b) protects B from A's Revocation.
                    (c) Prep. to perform !count.
                    (d) UCC: Notice req'd UCC 2-206
        6. Terminax of Offer
            1. Death/Incapax of A/B R2K 48
            2. Delay in Communicax of Offer R2K 49
            3. Terminax of Irrevokable Offer
                (1) lapse of time
                (2) Death/incapax
                (3) Revocation and rejecx R2K 36 R2K 37
                (4) Death/Distrux & Supervenq Legal Prohibix

    C. Answer (Acceptance, Rejecx, C-Offer, RFI)
        1. Power of Acceptance
        "An offer may create power of acceptance 1) in a person or class, 2)
        or in any who makes a promise or renders performance." R2K 29(2)
            a. Lapse of Time
            "B's PoA terminates at 1) A's express time 2) or reasonable time
            (jury)." R2K 41(1)

            b. Late Acceptance
                History: new offer from B; needs communicated acceptance
                Middle:  if w/n reas. time; A must respond in reas. time
                Modern:  A can waive lateness.

            c. Revocation by Comm. from A to B
            "B's PoA dead 1) when B knows 2) A manifests intent not to K." 
            R2K 42

            b. Terminax of Power of Acceptance
                "B's power of acceptance may be terminated by 1) rejecx or
                counter-offer by the B, or 2) lapse of time, or 3) Revocation by A,
                or 4) death or incapacity of A/B or 5) by non-occurrence of condix
                of acceptanced under terms of offer." R2K 36
                    _C. Durax of Offeree's Power of Acceptance 35-49_

            c. Terminax under Opx K
            "B can't terminate opx-k unless meets . . . ?"
            R2K 37

        2. Acceptance
            a. Time When Acceptance Takes Affect
            "Unless offer provides otherwise, acceptance to offer becomes
            operative and manifests mutual assent as soon as leaves B,
            regardless of if reaches A." R2K 63(1)

            b. Acceptance Under Opx K.
            "Unless offer provides otherwise, acceptance under opx K !operative
            until received by A." R2K 63(2)
                a. "Just because B can later retrieve acceptance from medium
                doesn't prevent acceptance upon transmit." R2K 63 (note c)
                b. "Can't revoke after acceptance, (but can accept after Revocation
                if acceptance beats Revocation)" R2K 63 (note c).

            c. Acceptance Instantaneous communicax
            "Instantanous communicax media (e.g. telephone) governed by same
            std. as when parties are in mutual presence" R2K 64

            d. Acceptance Non-Instantaneous communicax

            e. Reasonablness of Medium
            "Unless B knows otherwise, acceptance may be transmitted 1) by A's
            offer medium or 2) customary medium for such transax" R2K 65

        3. Rejecx
        "B's power of acceptance terminated by B's Revocation of offer" 
        R2K 38(1)

        "B's manifest intent !enter K rejex unless B manifests intent to take
        under further advisement." R2K 38(2)

        4. C-Offer
        "Counter-offer is offer 1) from B to A 2) relatq to same matter
        3) but with different bargain." R2K 39(1)

    D. Postponed Bargaining: Agreement to Agree:
        1. UCC 2-204: A contract with one or more open terms does not
        automatically fail if:
            a. the parties intended to make a contract, and
            b. there is a reasonably certain basis for determining a breach.
        2. R2K 27: A contract does not fail if the parties intended to adopt a
        writing; but the failure to adopt a writing may suggest preliminary
        Negotiations.
        3. UCC 2-305: an 'open price' term does not necessarily invalidate a
        contract if the parties intend to be bound.
            a. Excepx: Walker v. Keith Where essential terms, such as price,
            are not contained in an opx contract and no standards are
            included whereby it may be judicially determined, no contract
            exists.
            b. To be enforceable and valid, a contract to enter into a future
            covenant must specify all material and essential terms and leave
            nothing to be agreed upon as a result of future Negotiations.
        4. Quake Construcx v. AA: Although letters of intent may be
        enforceable, such letters are not necessarily enforceable unless the
        parties intend them to be contractually binding.
        5. Agreements to agree must be executed in good faith.

    E. Battle of Forms
        _First, prove that transax is of goods_
        A.C.A. 1162-1289
        1. Type One: Offer and Acceptance
            a. UCC Acceptance (SALES) UCC 2-201(1)
            "Under UCC 2-207, acceptance requires 1) seasonable and 2) definite
            exprex of accept. 3) even if different non-transaxal terms 4) unless
            accept. is expressly condixial upon assent to those terms."
                (1) "unless" = counter-offer
                (2) "diff. non-transaxal terms" = viol. common law.

            b. Counter-Offer (SALES)
            "Under UCC 2-207, B's counter-offer is accepted only 1) when clear A
            aware of alterax in terms and 2) manifestly assented by 2)
            unambiguous words or acx."
                (1) !K           if !acceptance/performance by A
                (2) B's K        if Clear Manifestations of acceptance by A
                (3) UCC 2-207(3) if no acceptance but performance 

            c. Treatment of Proposals in Acceptance UCC 2-207(2)
            "Under UCC 2-207(2), addix terms construed as proposed addix to K
            b/w merchants unless 1) offer expressly limits accept. 2) terms
            materially alter, or 3) notificax of objex given w/n reasonable time
            after receipt of notice"
                (1) "unless" helps prevent added terms from entering K.
                (2) term !enter if materially (subst. bargained-for) alters
                (3) "Surprise" common term obj. defined
                (4) "Hardship" unbargained-for/detracts from RM expectax
                (5) term excluded if offer limits acceptance to its terms.
                (6) "Accept. & Diff." v. "Diff" Court's treatment
                    (a) Inadvertant: apply subsec. anyway
                    (b) Disregard: (response) ? accept. : exclude uni-proposals
                    (c) Knockout: conflict terms cancel out.
                    (d) UCC 2-513: if implied : Buyer RM time to inspect/reject.
                    (e) UCC 2-513 and UCC 2-601: Buyer RM time to inspect/reject.

            d. Mutual Performance w/o K UCC 2-207(3)
            "When no written K formed, 1) conduct by parties establishes K, and
            2) K's terms are those mutually agreed upon; 3) terms incorporated
            under other provix of this Act."
                (1) Appliable: B's response = counter. w/o A's deliberate accept.
                (2) avoids unfairness of "last shot"
                (3) !deal with oral Ks.
                (4) UCC 2-308: delivery at seller's premises
                (5) UCC 2-310: cash payment on delivery
                (6) UCC 2-513 and UCC 2-601: Buyer RM time to inspect/reject.
                (7) UCC 2-326: Buyer no right to return unsold goods.

        2. Type Two: Confirmation
            a. Written Confirmation Following Oral/Informal K UCC 2-207(1)
            "Written Confirmation sent w/n RM time is acceptance though statq terms
            addix/diff. than agreed on, unless acceptance expressly made condix
            on assent to addix/diff. terms" (BOGUS).

            b. "Written docs. w/ different terms than oral K, do terms become
            part of K?" (Refer to Treatment of Proposals in Acceptance).

            c. Concern w/ clash b/w oral K and written Confirmation.

        3. UCC 2-104(1): Merchant is one who deals (in goods/by followq
        particular occupax), has/represents having knowledge/skills concernq
        goods.
            a. merchant if "profesxal" user of goods
            b. !merchant if casual/inexperienced sellor/buyer.

2. Is there a K? (Enforcing Promises: Bases of Legal Obligax)
    NO:
    A. Promissory Estoppel As Remedy? A's Detriment w/o Consideration
    "A promise which A should reasonably induce B's detriment, and Promissory
    estoppel exists when 1) A's promise should reasonably induce B's detriment,
    2) B subtancially and detrimentally relied, and 3) injustice avoided by
    enforcing A's promise." R2K 90.
        1. Consideration Substitux
            old: limited PE to enforcing gratuitious promises.
            new: trend toward use to rescue failing Ks where Consideration is not
                 cause of failure.
            (3) afford relif for reli. on prom. short o K b/c (defect|omix) in
                agreement formed by parties.
        2. Reliance on Offers
            Ex. Contractor (A) uses sub-K's (B) low bid in preparing bid for proj.
            (B's bid is bilateral K)
            (1) When offer looks to bilat. K, PE unusual to make irrevok.
            Normally, an offere must accept. Sub-K is excepx.
            (2) B's bid is unrevokable due to justifiable injurious reliance.
            (3) Unjustifiable reliance if B's bit too low so as to indicate
            mistake.
            (4) Later bid-shopping or -chiseling by A terminates.
            (5) While B bound, A not.
            (6) Unilat-K offer renders irrevoc R2K 45, which does not protect
            against Revocation. PE fills the gap.
        3. PE Under Indefinite Agreement
            Ex. New-hire quits job, and turns down other offer. Learned another
            hired instead. No protecx under tradixal K approach.
            (1) PE used to salvage indefinite Ks.
            (2) Under PE, maybe damage based on lost job opportunity costs.
        4. Promises made durq Preliminary Negotiation
            Ex. A offers supermarket francise, and B takes serious steps to
            secure. When met original terms, A upped the antie.
            (1) assumpx still in prelim. nego.
            (2) PE allows recovery limited to expense made in reliance.
            (3) Doct: _Culpa in ontrahendo_, recovery for losses incurred in
            preliminary nego. (from Civil Law naxs). (Naaxs)
            (4) PE also possible to punish lack of good faith nego.
        5. Agreements Disclaimq Legal Consequences
            (1) void bilat-K as basis for PE, posibilities almost limitless.
            (2) Modificax w/o Consideration R2K 89.
            (3) promises of surety inducing injurious reliance R2K 88.

    B. Unjust Enrichment As Remedy? (Quasi-K)
        "Unjust enrichment exists when 1) P benefited D, 2) D knew and accepted
        or retained benefit 3) such that inequitable/unjust D retain w/o
        payment." *Rstmt Rest 1*

        1. Excepx
            a. Unequal exchange is not unjust R2K 79.
            b. Moral Obligax not binding R2K ??
            c. "Implied in Fact" is a K.

        2. Officious
        P who officiously bestows benefit to D !entitled to
        restitux. *Rstmt Rest 2* (officious=just does it)

        2. Emergency Services
        "P can claim rest. from D for emerg. svcs given w/o D's knowing if 
        1) intent to charge, 2) P RM though D would consent, 3) D couldn't 
        consent or consent imaterial." *Rstmt Rest. 116*

        2. Care
        "P can claim rest. from D for preserving D's prop. w/o D's knowing if 
        1) intent to charge/keep if no owner, 2) PRM thought D would consent 
        3) in legal posex & expense not b/c of P's breech 4) expenses RM
        necessary 5) things accepted by owner." *Rstmt Rest. 117*

    C. Promissory Restitux
        1. Moral Obligax (normally, not enforceable R2K ??)
            a. MAJ: Subsequent promise unenforceable
            b. MIN: Promissory Restitux to prevent 
            "D's promise regarding prior benefit from P binding to extent
            needed to prevent injustice unless 1) prior benefit P's gift to
            D, or 2) extent its value disproproxate to benefit."
            (R2K 86)
        2. Promise Discharge Past Debt
            a. Bankruptcy
            "Express promise to pay on debtor's debt discharged in
            bankruptcy binding." (R2K 83)
                (2) 11 U.S.C.A. 524(c): promise in bankruptcy judgment or
                !binding. (Bankruptcy Reform Act 1978).

            b. Statute of Limitax (SoL) (R2K 82)
                *Binding*
                "D's promise to pay on past debt is binding if would be but
                for SOL."
                    (1) renews SOL
                    (2) !extend SoL in orig. agreement

                *Evidential*
                "A promise to pay is evidenced by 1) acknowledgment, 2)
                payment, or 3) willingness to forgo SOL def., 4) w/o facts
                showing different intent." (R2K 82)
                    (1) implied promise to pay.
                    (2) express contrary intent defeats
                    (3) most states require written statement. (unless payment)

        3. Voidable Duties (e.g. Fraud, mistake, duress, infancy)
            a. after voiding, D can ratify w/o new Consideration
            b. reinstatement can't also be voidable.

    YES: 
    A. Doctrine of Consideration: (Enforcement under K)
        "Consideration is 1) B's detriment 2) bargained-for by A 3) to induce A's
        promise." R2K 75

        "Promise/Performance bargained-for may benefit a third party" R2K 71(4)

        1. Legal Detriment: perform/abstain
            "Writ of debt" benefit to promisor.
            "Writ of assumpsit" detriment to promisee.
            a. legal detriment to P or benefit to D.
            c. detriment need not be sole or predominate inducement, just enough
            to be bargained for.
            _Hamer v. Sidway_
        2. Inducq the Promise
            a. detriment made to induce conduct of promisor.
            b. alt.: promisor has manifested an offerq state of mind, rather
            than gift-giving state of mind.
            c. Gratuitous promise not made with offerq state of mind.
        3. Promise induces Detriment: must know of offer and manifest intent to
        accept; actual or apparent inducement to act by the promise.

        4. "Bargained-For if 1) A seeks for his promise and 2) given by B for
        promise." R2K 71
            "Any performance bargained-for is Consideration" R2K 72.
            _Baehr v. Penn-O-Tex Oil_
        5. Past Consideration
            a. promisee neither knew of offer or had intent to accept when act
            done.
            b. violates "exchange" element.
            c. cannot bargain or exchange what has already occurred.
            _Plowman v. Indian Refining Co._
            d. exchange grounded in Adam Smith's theory of economics.
        6. Adequacy of Consideration
            "If Consideration reqs. met, no addixal req. for gain or loss to
            either party, equivalence of values exchanged or 'mutuality of
            obligx.'" R2K 79
            b. R2K 79 gross inadequacy o Consideration may be evidence of
            fraud, duress, mistake, lack o capacity, or undue influence.
            c. Illusory promises will not serve as Consideration because
            it makes no bindq commitment on the promisor.  
                1. Elvis Hypo: I'll sell you my bike if Elvis returns.
            d. Policy: A has a debt o $1M and at the same time promises
            B $1M.  The court may allow A to rescind gift to B because markets
            prefer that debtors are paid before gifts are given.
            e. Moral Consideration != Consideration
            _Batsakis v. Demotsis_
            f. _Haigh v. Brooks_: L 10,000 traded for worthless paper document.
            g. Excepx: Lawyer-Client retainer reviewed by courts for balance.
                (1) courts have vested interest
                (2) lawyers can be sancxed for charging excessive fees.
        7. Condix to Gift Distinguished.
            a. Does A manifest gift-makq state of mind? 
                The smallness of the detriment is factor to consider when
                determq if A has 'bargained for' detriment or if detriment is
                condix of gift.
            b. Is "detriment" beneficial to A? 
        8. Sham and Nominal Consideration
            a.  Sham Consideration is a K recites that Consideration was
            given, and it never was, a court will find no Consideration. (R2K 71)
                * Peppercorn Hypo: I'll sell you my bike for a peppercorn.
            b. Minor courts accept as if were real. R2K 87
                "offer is binding as opx K if it is in writing and signed by
                offer, recites a purported Consideration for the makq of the offer,
                and proposes an exchange on fair terms w/n reasonable time.
            c. Nominal amount to circumvent Consideration
                (1) R2K 71, do not enforce considrax
                (2) one view, accepting this pretense undermines Consideration.
        9. Mix of Gift & Bargain
            a. detriment must be sufficient cause of inducement. R2K 81 & R2K 71
            Ex.: If A out of friendship sells horse for $1k instead of its $5k
            value, then there is Consideration.
        10. Surrender of invalid claim as Detriment
            a. duty not to assert unfounded claim, tantamount to duress
            b. Earliest view says this not detriment.
                (1) Policy: favor settlements.
                (2) R2K 74
            c. Modern view: serves as Consideration when:
                (1) asserted in good faith (RM std.: not so obviously unfounded)
                (2) RM could believe claim well-founded.
                (3) objective uncertainty (R2K)
        11. Pre-Existing Duty R2K 89
            B promises to do/forbear what is already legally obligated to
            do/forbear, then no detriment.
            a. Mods to K not binding due to lack of Consideration
                Ex.: B agrees to work for $900, then next week A agrees to increase
                salary by $100. B has no detriment.
                Ex.: B agrees to work for $900. A & B agree to recend K. B
                agrees to works for $1000. Detriment.
            b. UCC abolishes pre-existing duty [UCC s 2-209(1)]
            c. Agreement to accept partial payment of debt: not binding
                (1) Modern trend: to make enforceible.
                (2) Disputed Debt: good faith & RM believes less & agree, then
                binding.
        12. Bi-Ks and Consideration
            a. investigate promises for detriment.
            b. non-binding promise Consideration if performance detrimental R2K 75
        13. Uni-Ks: Consideration when promisee performs, is detrimental,
            and bargained-for.
            "where the offeror seeks only performance and not promise."
            a. subtancial performance is sufficient. R2K 45
            b. Revocation at a moment's notice is old school.
            c. Revocation at last moment hits R2K 45(f).

3. Is there a writing?
    YES:
    B. Parol Evidence Rule
        Policy: General approach is to suspect any attempt by party to
        introduce evidence that embelishes/contradicts writing.

        1. Integrax:
        "A writing is completely integrated when 1) exclusivity intent and
        2) clear & unambiguous expresx of 3) every term in agreement.
            a. 4-Corners: yes if doc. complete, unambig. & !obvious
            gap/inconsistency
            b. Modern: yes if 4-corners and contextual evidence as well."

        2. Consistency:
        "Parol evidence admissible 1) suppliment/explain writing 2) so long
        as doesn't vary/contradict the writing"
            a. Loose: if !directly contradict express terms.
            b. Tight: (Loose) && !contradict implied terms.

        3. Excepxs:
            a. "Parol evidence admissible to show 1) fraud, 2) duress,
            3) mistake, or 4) other bases for invalidating/avoiding K."
            b. "Parol evidence admissible to show fact in writing is false."
            c. "Parol evidence admissible to show writing subj. to condix."
            d. "allowd to show if ambiguous (class) or alternative (modern)"

        4. Collateral Agreement Rule (Excepx to Parol Evidence Rule)
        "A collateral agreement is sufficiently distinct from scope of
        writing to not be integrated into it, and subject matter is
        consistent w/ writing"

        "Agreement is not integrated if omits consistent addix term that is
        1) based on separate Consideration, and 2) might naturally have been
        omitted from the agreement."

        Different positions:
            1. Pos 1: any contradicx is out
            1. Pos 2: can, even if contradict
            1. Nuance: can override, but not always.

            "Can override boilerplate if UOT shows boilerplate not in keeping w/
            times."

        5. Restricx on Oral Modificax
        "No Oral Mod." clause defeatable by oral mod; weak clause.  UCC
        2-209 seems to support "no oral mod.", but UCC 2-209(4) allows a
        waiver of rights under original K, and UCC 2-209(5) says waiver
        effective.

4. What are the Terms?
    A. Implied Terms

1. Contract Interpretation
    1. Subjective
        1. Different meaning of terms = !meeting of minds
        Policy: No autonomy
    1. Objective
        1. objective manif. RM
        Policy: 1. obj. theory
                2. fairness
                3. efficency: reliable.

        modified obj. approach
            step 1. parties agree
                yes: Then meaning controls
            no step 2: who knew or shoulw have known about otherwise
            step 3: no K -- as to that prov. may still be K.

        Step 1: Attach some meaning
        Step 2: Know/Should have known
        Step 3: No K

    1. Gen. Rules of Interpretation
        1. Ct. interp. agreement giving effect to all terms.
        2. Ut res magis valeat quam peret: favor K validating term.
        3. Specific/precise provisix weightier than general provisix.
        4. Resolve conflicts in favor of Negotiation/handwritten terms.
        5. Ejudem generis: Define general provisix by specific ones
            "skateboards, skates, other locomox": locomox = wheels under feet.
        6. Noscitur a socii: Meaning of words in series affects each other.

        8. Contra proferentum: "Favor drafted K to non-drafting party."
            "tie-breaker"

    1. Agree to Agree: parties commit to good faith Negotiation.
        1. P must give credible evidence of RM expectax each would strive to K.
        2. may suggest duty to make open-minded/coop. effort to resolve.
    1. Agree to Record in Writing
        1. intent to oral K, then writing is formality
        2. oral agreement precursor to settlement of terms in writing.
        3. good faith effort to Negotiation
    1. Misunderstanding: Total Ambiguity

        "A material misunderstanding precludes K Formation when parties were
        1) equally innocent in not RM realizing misunderstanding or 2) equally
        at fault in realizing but saying nothing." R2K 20

        "A term is defined by the mutual understanding of its meaning." R2K 201

        "A contract exists on the term understood by the more innocent party
        1) when a material misunderstanding exists and 2) other is more 
        accountable for knowing of the misunderstanding." R2K 201

        "Ambiguities are construed against the drafting party." R2K 206

        1. Standards of Preference (gen applic in K Interpretation)
        "an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective
        meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves
        a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect." R2K 203a

        "The relative weight of evidence, in order, is: 1) express terms, 2)
        course of performance, 3) course of dealing, and 4) trade usage." 
        R2K 203b

        "Specific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general
        language." R2K 203c

        "Separately negotiated/added terms are given greater weight than
        standardized terms or other terms not separately negotiated." R2K 203d

        "When multiple reas. meanings exist & public interest involved, favor
        the meaning favoring the public interest should be favored." R2K 207

        1. To Resolve Ambiguous Ks, Consider:

32.  Adhex Contracts     369-381

1.  Doctrine of reasonable expectax: (applies to adhex contracts)

    A. Contract should be interpreted in light of the objective reasonable
    expectaxs of the insured

    B. The objective reasonable expectaxs of the average insured will be
    applied where the party did not receive full and adequate notice of the
    provix. and
        1. policy provix is quesx is unusual or unexpected, or 
        2. policy provix effectively emasculates the apparent coverage;
        3. activity, prior to contracting, created an objective impresx of
        coverage as to a reasonable insured;
        4. act by the insurer, prior to contracting, caused this particular
        insured to reasonably believe that he has coverage, although such
        coverage is denied by the policy
    C.  Ask:
        1. this a standard form?
        2. it an adhex contract?
        3. there a serious imbalance of bargaining power?
        4. we apply the reasonable expectax doctrine?
            a.  Is the term bizarre?  or
            b.  Is it oppressive?  or
            c.  Does it eviscerate:
                (1) non-standard terms that were explicitly agreed to?  or
                (2) the dominant purpose of the contract?
                    * C&J Fertilizer v. Allied Mutual Ins.: A provix of an

38.  Implied Obligaxs of Good Faith   441-455

39.  Good Faith Under the UCC and Employment Contracts 455-477

    1. Good Faith Defined

    "Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair
    dealing in its performance and its enforcement." R2K 205
        a. normal
        "Good faith is honesty in fact in the conduct/transax concerned." 
        UCC 1-201(19)

        b. merchant
        "Good faith honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial
        standards of fair dealing in the trade." UCC 2-103(1)(b)

    "Good faith perform/enforce of K emphasizes faithfulness to agreed common
    purpose & consistency w/ justified expectax of other party"
        Bad Faith: violate community standards of decency, fairness or reas.

    1. Good faith performance. Subterfuges and evaxs violate the obligax
    of good faith in performance even though the actor believes his conduct to
    be justified. But the obligax goes further: bad faith may be overt or may
    consist of inacx, and fair dealing may require more than honesty. A
    complete catalogue of types of bad faith is impossible, but the following
    types are among those which have been recognized in judicial decixs:
    evax of the spirit of the bargain, lack of diligence and slacking off,
    willful rendering of imperfect performance, abuse of a power to specify
    terms, and interference with or failure to cooperate in the other party's
    performance.
