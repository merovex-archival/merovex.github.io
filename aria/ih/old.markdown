## Overview

This is a weak attempt to retell the [Aria Interactive History](www.amazon.com/Aria-Worlds-Series-Canticle-Monomyth/dp/096459031X/) concept using Savage rules. "Aria is principally a game of epic narrative interaction and mythmaking." Aria's focus is on mythmaking, meta-design, and playable realism. Savage World's goal is "Fast, Furious & Fun."

Rather than play a single person, a player plays a family,lineage or nation and its effect on its environment. This develops a Grand Narrative of mythic history. It uses "Narrative Time"


## Interactive History

* Supports Grand Narrative
* Larger than single persona, play family or lineage and its effect on environment
* Build up a mythic history as part of Grand Narrative
* Aria Narrative Environments are meant to be dynamic changing environments
IH is a great tool for developing a rich Narrative Environment
* Can intersperse Aria time with Narrative time to age environment with characters – dead character son’s matures to carry on father’s fight etc.
* Persona’s can influence Society Trials via Leverage pools (sway the unfolding of history)
* Players can also play whole societies or organizations through IH
* IH are an abstract element of the Aria game, and their purpose is to foster interaction and storytelling on a grand scale.
* The results gained from IH must be translated through the lens of the narrative environment/society to which they apply.
* For instance, an economic regression for small society might be loss of a shipment of grain, large empire could be destruction of large part of resource base.

#### Secondary forces

A nation typically has primary forces (standing, in arms all or most of the time) and secondary forces (provisional, raised in times of crisis). During peace time, nations do not have armed secondary forces.

By using an action, a nation can raise (the) secondary forces. Forces equal to one less than the specified size can be raised without problems. However, each size increament after that decreases exploitation (or e.g. resources) of the society by -1 for that year. In case of severe losses in battle, these decreaments start to effect future years, too.

#### Supply

In battle, an army without a secure supply line suffers a -1 to force for every year it is cut off. The exceptions are small armies capable of &lsquo;living off the land&rsquo; and rare instances where an entire clan moves with the army.

#### Recovering

When the army is struck by casualities, its mother society can replenish the army by up to base size -1 of the army type (primary/secondary). An army without a secure supply line to its mother society will not be able to recover.

#### Military Conflict Resolution

1. **Battle force:** First determine the largest military unit on battle field. Then reduce the Force of all other military units by their size difference with that unit. The actual Force value of each side is the maximum of the Force values of its military units after reduction.
1. **Modifiers:** Take special modifiers into account: fortifications, military leaders, relative magic force, moral. If on its own ground, the defending army gets +1.
1. **Winning:** Roll 4DF for both sides. Best result wins. The win-loose ratio in manforce is 1:(Result+1). For example on winning result of +2, the win-loose ratio is 1:3. What this means is that for every dead on the winning side, there is 3 dead on the loosing side.
1. **Casualities:** To determine the actual casualities, decide what are the casualities of the winning side. As a default take the average of total army size on both sides and reduce it by two. This is modified by the bloodiness of the battle: for very savage battle reduce only by one, for a formal battle reduce by three. This is the amount of casualities taken by the winning side. The loosing side takes casualities as indicated by the win-loose ratio. The ratio can be translated to unit Size values by taking into account that the mancount triples for every Size-increase, ie. for 1:3 ratio there is +1, for 1:9 there is +2.
1. **Other results:** Besides casualities, there may be other effects: tactical advantages or special effects.

### Disasters and critical junctures

There are several different kind of natural environmental disasters: an epidemic is the most common, with famine coming close second. Other disasters include a flood, hurricane, earthquake, tornado and drought. The disaster is always assumed to be worst of its kind, so the task should be appropriately difficult. The action determinant is the scope of the society +1, and the task level should be Huge or Epic (-3 or -4). In Elyria game the rounds are 1 year each. To get to the 10%25 for a 5 year period, a ~2%25 per year chance is used, or +-4 on 4DF.

Critical junctures are societal/political situations of depression or unrest. An internal critical juncture appears if:

* the ruling agency tyrannizes its people (Power - Authority &gt;= +2)
* consent or power is very low (Consent / Power &gt;= Poor)
* tolerance of any humanity is very low (Tolerance &gt;= Terrible and Prevalence &gt;= Mediocre)
* severe economic depression (Wealth &gt;= Terrible)
* a severe political scandal has occured, like a negotations pledge is broken, an intrigue attempt is failed, ... 


External critical juncture occures if some society has severily meddled in some other societies actions, or their relations have dropped below Poor (Relations &gt;= Terrible). The difficulity of a critical juncture is either Hard or Very hard (-1 or -2).

### Number of actions

The basic number of actions per society is 4. This can be varied, however:

1.  extra: -1 to the extra action
1.  extras: -1 to both extras, and a -1 to one additional
1.  extras: -1 to all extras, and -1 to two additionals
1.  extras: all at -1

You can try to remove the action penalty (on a per action basis) by stating that you go cautiously or try something small (relavetive to society scope, of course). The effects won&rsquo;t be that great in the case, though. You can also submit fewer actions, ie. expend extra effort to some actions:

1.  less: +1 on one action (also called a &ldquo;double&rdquo; action)
1.  less: +1 on two actions
1.  less: +2 on one action

### Strategic actions

Strategic actions are announced with the keyword &lsquo;strategic&rsquo;. They stretch over a longer period of time, at least two years, at the end of which they are resolved. However, the length of the strategic action need not be declared beforehand. The player just continues the action until he feels that it is ripe time to resolve it. As specific steps, the resolution goes as follows:

1.  Player declares strategic action, giving the goal or time estimation.
1.  GM determines basic difficulity or gives a time estimation.
1.  The player need not adhere to his chosen time limit, however if he uses less time, he&rsquo;ll get penalties:

<table class='table table-condensed'>
  <tr>
    <td>1/4 of time</td>
    <td>-3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/2 of time</td>
    <td>-2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/4 of time</td>
    <td>-1</td>
  </tr>
</table>      


Extra time will grant positive modifiers, for example:

<table class='table table-condensed'>
 <tr>
   <td>1.5x the time</td<td> +1</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>2x the time </td><td> +2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>3x of time </td><td>+3</td>
 </tr>
</table>

1.  Each round the GM rolls 1DF and tells the player how the project fares. The player may also get modifiers to the strategic action by making appropriately linked normal actions.
1.  On the resolve year, decided by the player, 4DF is rolled. This is summed with all previous rolls (and other possible modifiers) and this is multiplied by 4/(N+4) where N is the number of years.

### Resolution

Task resolution in FUDGE is very simple: Result = Skill &ndash; Task + Dice

In IH context the Skill equals the average of the respective determinants. The task is Normal (0) by default. Both of these can be modified if the situation so warrants. Consult the list below for guidelines on modifiers:

<table class='table table-condensed'>
  <tr>
    <th scope='row'>0  </th>
    <td>for unsignificant change in Task/Skill or a small effect from a separately dtermined random component</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope='row'>+-1</th>
    <td>for a significant change or a normal effect (think about increasing task level from normal to hard)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope='row'>+-2</th>
    <td>for a big change (task level from normal to very hard) or several (&gt;2) significant changes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope='row'>+-3</th>
    <td>for an overwhelming change (task level from normal to huge) or several big changes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Elyria the actions will get bonuses for extensive planning/descriptions in the actions description.

### Technological advancement

Depending on the goal the task of making technological advancement is from very hard (-2) to epic (-4) with a tactical action. With strategic action of appropriate length this is lessened to normal in proportion to basic probability:

<table class='table table-condensed'>
  <tr>
    <th>Very hard (-2)</th>
    <td>task becomes normal with 1/0.18 = 5 years,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Huge (-3)     </th>
    <td>task becomes normal with 1/0.06 = 17 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Epic task (-4)</th>
    <td>task becomes normal with 1/0.01 = 100 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Scope naturally effects the difficulity. Determinants include wealth, resources, scholastics (and possibly magic) prevalence and diversity. The social attitude towards research are governed by scholastics (and/or magic) tolerance.

The results of innovation action may be determined as follows: the success value is used as a base point pool. The various effects have point values and the GM picks out a suitable set.

<table class='table table-condensed'>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>the attempt succeeds!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>there is naturally a great demand for it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>no need to spread the innovation &ndash; just by existing it benefits everyone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>it spreads the customer base of the society benefits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>a celebrated artist/crafter who uses the new technique</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+1</td>
    <td>a genuine technology advance</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>opponents can easily adapt to it (e.g. in warfare)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>it is easy to plagiarize (e.g. a new model/fashion)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>it's a great innovation, but it has no real (apparent) use</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>penalties to spreading attempt (e.g. morally questionable)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>setbacks in resources/consent/wealth, shift in power balance</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>there is a hidden flaw (e.g. it isn&rsquo;t profitable after all</td>
  </tr>
</table>
