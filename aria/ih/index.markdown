## Overview

This is a weak attempt to retell the [Aria Interactive History](www.amazon.com/Aria-Worlds-Series-Canticle-Monomyth/dp/096459031X/) concept using Savage rules. "Aria is principally a game of epic narrative interaction and mythmaking." Aria's focus is on mythmaking, meta-design, and playable realism. Savage World's goal is "Fast, Furious & Fun."

Rather than play a single person, a player plays a family,lineage or nation and its effect on its environment. This develops a Grand Narrative of mythic history. It uses "Narrative Time"


## Interactive History

* Supports Grand Narrative
* Larger than single persona, play family or lineage and its effect on environment
* Build up a mythic history as part of Grand Narrative
* Aria Narrative Environments are meant to be dynamic changing environments
IH is a great tool for developing a rich Narrative Environment
* Can intersperse Aria time with Narrative time to age environment with characters – dead character son’s matures to carry on father’s fight etc.
* Persona’s can influence Society Trials via Leverage pools (sway the unfolding of history)
* Players can also play whole societies or organizations through IH
* IH are an abstract element of the Aria game, and their purpose is to foster interaction and storytelling on a grand scale.
* The results gained from IH must be translated through the lens of the narrative environment/society to which they apply.
* For instance, an economic regression for small society might be loss of a shipment of grain, large empire could be destruction of large part of resource base.

## Creating a Society

### Society Foundation

<abbr title='Aria: Interactive History'>ARIA-IH</abbr> uses four Determinants to define the Society's Foundation, or personality.

A Society's **Age** affects much of its character. Younger societies are more aggressive while older societies more reserved. *Aria: Worlds* uses Age as the fundamental modifier for Philosophical Orientation, Interaction and Isolation.

A Society's **Philosophical Orientation** is its underlying belief system and behavior&mdash;its core personality. There are six philosophies (
  Survival,
  War,
  Conquest,
  Equilibrium, and
  Peace and Knowledge)
and how a society pursues its philosophy may be either active or passive. [^Orientations]
**Social Aspects** describe a Society's its ideals, values or emotive character&mdash;personality traits.
There are six aspects (
  Acquisition,
  Conviction,
  Prevention,
  Tradition,
  Stagnation, and
  Revolution),
which are specifically associated with a goal (e.g. Acquisition: Wealth).[^Aspects]

A Society's **Interaction** describes its diplomatic economic, military, scientific or social interaction with other societies.[^Interaction] By contrast, a Society's **Isolation** describes how difficult it is for other Societies (and people) to access its physical territory.[^Isolation] Barriers may be natural or artificial. A highly Interactive Society may work hard to overcome its high Isolation, or a low Isolation, low Interactive Society may work to increase its isolation by adding artificial barriers (e.g. Great Wall of China).

### Technology & Innovation

After the Social Foundation is established, ARIA-IH identifies the Technology & Innovation. The **Technology Value** describes the average technology level and advancement for the Society. It is derived from the average of  seven **Innovation Scales** (below), of which Dominant Materials is a significant influencer, so much so that no other Scale may exceed the Dominant Materials scale.[^TechnologyScales] **Cultural Innovation** involves artistry, patterns of education and religion, etc. and is developed as part of the History Profile.

1. Dominant Materials (D),
2. Power & Manufacturing (P),
3. Agriculture & Environmental (A),
4. Construction & Architectural (C),
5. Transport & Communication (T),
6. Military (M), and
7. Miscellaneous (U)

The climate of Innovation is identified by a Society's Rate of Advancement (research) or Rate of Assimilation (acquisition). A Society can **Emphasize** up-to four Innovation Scales (D, P, A, C, T, M, U), depending on the degree of innovation. Innovation Emphasis is further defined by **Innovation Aspects**, similar to Social Aspects, above. The **Primary Scale** is the Innovation Scale of Dominant Materials, and **Secondary Scale** is any of the other Innovation Scales.

The **Technological Rate of Advancement** (TRAdv) is an amalgam of social involvement (need, resources, ethos) and Philosophical Orientation. It is described by a value of one to 10 (1&ndash;10) and set by the GM using rough guidelines.[^TRAdv] This is the difficulty level a Society uses when determining whether a given Technology Scale levels up. The difficulty of attempting to Advance the Dominant Materials Scale is Double. 

A successful Trial is applied to the most logical Innovation Scale. It is not possible to advance a Secondary Scale beyond the Primary Scale.

The **Technological Rate of Assimilation** (TRAsm) enables a technologically inferior neighbor to acquire technology from accessible, advanced neighbors. There is no increased difficulty when attempting to Assimilate the Dominant Materials Scale. Difficulty is increased by the difference between the attempted Secondary Scale increase and the Primary Scale (i.e. Secondary &minus; Primary), and cannot exceed beyond one-half the TRAsm (1/2 TRAsm).

**Technology Trials.** Technology trials occur when the Society is attempting to improve an Innovation Level by developing (TRAdv) or acquiring (TRAsm) technology. 
The annual rate of attempting a trial depends on whether the Society is 'Civlized' or 'Primative'.
A modifier should be applied when the Trial occurs within a Technological Emphasis (+1) or Technological Aspect (+2).
A successful Trial is applied to the most logical Innovation Scale.

* **Rate.** 2 &times; IS (Civilized); 10 &times; IS (Primitive) in years.
* **Trial Level.** 1/2 Innovation Scale
* **Trial Base.** Zero
* **Difficulty Multipliers.** 2 &times; (Dominant Materials when Advancing); 1 &times; (All Other Attempts);
* **Assimilating Difficulty Modifiers** + (Secondary &minus; Primary when Secondary &#8805; Primary); Trade Value & Interaction Value
* **Emphasis/Aspect Bonus.** +1 (Emphasis); +2 (Aspect)
* **Ceiling.** Advance: Secondary &#8804; Primary. Assimilate: Secondary &#8804; 1.5 &times; Primary

**Available Technology.** When Assimilated technology of a Secondary Scale exceeds the Primary Scale, it is available for use by the Society, but cannot yet be produced by the Society. Access to this technology changes with changes in Interaction and Isolation. When Dominant Materials Assimilations occur, it is a permanent Innovation Level improvement when the change is to the means and not materials (e.g., improved ways of producing Iron, but not Bronze Age access to Iron).

### Subsistence & Mobility

How a Society sustains itself on a daily basis is its **Subsistence Classification**. This is its overall Technology Value, plus half its Interaction value when it interacts with more technologically advanced neighbors.

* Subsistence Value = Average Tech Value + (Interaction &divide; 2, with Advanced Neighbors)

**Subsistence Classification:** This is a fairly subjective assessment based on diverse environmental factors.

* 1&ndash;3 Hunter/Gatherer
* 4&ndash;10 Incipient Agriculture (Hunting, Herding, Fishing)
* 5&ndash;10 Possible Dual Incipient/Fully Agricultural
* 5&ndash;20 Fully Agricultural

**Social Mobility** involves migration patterns: nomadic (&lt;6), semi-nomadic & sedentary (&gt;15).

* Mobility = d10 + Age/2 + Orientation + 0.2(Interaction + Technology) - Isolation/5 + Modifiers
* Modifiers:
  - Hunters: -20
  - Incipient Agriculture: -10 Primary Hunter/Herder; +10 Primary Fisher; -5 Primary Herder; +5 Primary Fisher
  - Fully Agricultural: +20

### Politics & Kinship

The **Political Infrastructure** comprises four items:

* Authority: Vested right to Act
* Consent: People's support for the authority
* Power: Ability to act
* Constitutional Support: Coherency of working principles

**Formula:**

PI = d100 + Age - 0.2Isolation + 0.2Interaction + Technology/2

When advanced, add the Orientation Modifier.

**Legal Code.**

**Theocratic Ideal.**

## Random Society Generator

**Developing Social Foundation.** ARIA-IH's approach to foundation is a . Thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I provide a quick generator. It will start with a generated result. If you want to create new societies, enter the Code field and hit the any key except ENTER, TAB and other browser-control keys.

ARIA-IH uses [series of dice rolls](/aria/ih/tables#social) to define the Social Foundation. I've taken the liberty of creating a simple generator. I'm also using the Traveller RPG code method for shorthand, using Base<sub>20</sub> (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15, G=15, H=17, K=18, L=19, M=20).

* Age Value (0-A)
* Philosophy (Uppercase = Active, Lowercase = Passive; S,W,C,E,P,K)
* Isolation Value (0-M)
* Interaction Value (0-M)
