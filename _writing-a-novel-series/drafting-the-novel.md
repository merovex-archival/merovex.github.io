Once you have finished the overall Series Outline, which comprises the outlines for the eight novels, you are ready to start drafting novels.

Until you know your writing pace, assume 500 words per hour, or about 120 hours to complete the Alpha draft (15 weeks at 8 hours/ week). Assume the second draft will take 1/2 that time. Thus, the first two drafts would run 180 hours, 23 weeks or six months.

The Third draft requires feedback, which takes time. During that time, you should start drafting the next novel. That gives them about three months, and gives you time to get the draft of another novel done. The Third Draft would take perhaps 30 hours to address, and another 30 hours for the final draft. A total of 240 hours per novel.

### First Real Draft (Alpha - Tell Yourself the Story)

The previous section really is the first draft, so this could just as easily be considered the second draft. Randy calls this the first *real* draft. How long it takes to write this is based on your pace. I've managed to write about 600 words per hour. From that optic, a rough draft of 65 k-words is about 110 hours.

The purpose of the first draft is to tell yourself the story. You have done most of that in the Design above. But as Randy says, about 1/2 of the way through you will have to go back and revise your documents. I recommend doing it once per Act.

Your writing will be sloppy. You'll be telling, not showing in places. Fine. When you have to fake something (character name), put "TK" (very few English words have the letters TK) so you can find it later. Such as, "TK-CHARACTER."

Keep a TODO list. When you name a character,  you will need to take tie to develop the character (Novel Snowflake-3) to ensure the character isn't cardboard.

### Second Draft (Beta - Tell Your Audience Your Story)

The purpose of the second draft is to tell your audience. Go back through and fix the narrative. Some suggest this should be a full draft. The point is, do not be emotionally attached to what you wrote in the first draft. Where you are emotionally attached, there you will fail.

### Third Draft (Incorporate First Reader Feedback)

After the second draft is complete, send it to some trusted readers and ask for their feedback. When you have that feedback, go back through and incorporate that feedback.

### Final Draft (Omit Needless Words)

Now go back through the book and omit needless words. The purpose here is to be lean in your story telling.
