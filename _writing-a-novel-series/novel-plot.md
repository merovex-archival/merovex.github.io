### Plotting the Novels (8 Hours)

Once you have the Series Plot, take the time to develop the novels by following each Snowflake Step. The Series Plot gives you Snowflake-1 for all novels. By the end of this step, you will likely have invested a total of 13-15 hours in the entire series.

The next step is to take 8 hours to expand each Novel plot per Snowflake-2. Since you will have recurring characters, try to see how they intermix. You will still have an overall series hero and a series opponent...though it is entirely possible that the real hero/opponent are concepts. For example, a novel series could be a grand battle between liberty and oppression and the different viewpoint characters each representatives of the concept. The result of Novel Snowflake-2 is Series Snowflake-4.

### Novel & Series Characters (10-20 Hours)

Once you've completed Novel Snowflake-2, you likely have a four-page Series Summary (Series Snowflake-6). There are intermediary steps (series-related character, etc.) that have been overlooked. Take the time now to go back and develop the Series-relevant characters.

If you look at Snowflake, each character has a novel-specific goal and all that goal-seeking entails. Take the time to develop Novel-Snowflake-3 for each of the novels. Start by having one write-up for each of the viewpoint characters (Hero, Opponent, Confidant).

That will help you understand your viewpoint characters. Once the character synopses are done, develop Series Snowflake-3 (Series Character synopsis) that encompasses the novels. The result will be a character synopsis for development through the novels.

Repeat the process for Step 5 (Novel Snowflake-5, Series Snowflake-5) after you've finished the next bit.

When writing the storyline for the character, a helpful mental model is to think that each character thinks the story is about them. The Hero and Opposition both have the same goal, but only one can attain it and they are actively fighting one another. The Confidant's goal is to help the Hero attain his goal. Typically, the Opposition is successful until the end; and the likely failure is the inability to change.

This stage will take many hours, probably 10-20.

### Novel Plotting Leads to Thirty Page Series Outline (50-80 Hours)

Here's where I start mixing Snowflake with Marshall and 8-Segment. This could go wrong, so be patient...or toss what doesn't fit in your story. I am very probably creating a straight jacket that is unnecessary.

Snowflake-3 gives you each viewpoint character's storyline. Marshall provides a layout for intermingling. The hero gets most of the scenes (31). Opposition gets ten, and the Confidant gets nine.

The goal is to write one sentence that corresponds to each of the scenes below. The result is somewhere around Novel Snowflake-6 and Novel Snowflake-8.

When complete, you will have somewhere around four pages. If you do the same thing for every novel, then you will have a roughly 30-page Series outline.

This stage will take a week per novel...or two months.

### Scene Plotting (Varies)

This can be overkill, so proceed with confidence.

Novel Snowflake-9 is about expanding the scene sentences above into paragraphs. At its core, a scene has participants, setting, the conflict and the resolution. One may argue 2-5 paragraphs per page to describe each scene. Thus, a this step would produce 10-30 pages of solid narrative. The entire series could then be described in 80-240 pages. I would assume it would end up somewhere around 65 k-words itself, or the length of a novel. But, at this point, you have essentially rough-drafted every novel. Randy says this step is optional, but likely a good idea for a starting writer.

This stage will take a few months. If you include this step with all of the above, it will likely take a full year to develop the series to this level of detail. However, by this point you would have an amazing amount of detail.
