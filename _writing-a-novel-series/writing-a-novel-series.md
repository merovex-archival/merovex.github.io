## Overview

This page is my attempt to distill my approach to getting published. It's about creating the right series and novel design documentation. It's about understanding the business aspect of self-publishing, and the slog involved.

The concept is to build a career from writing 8-novel series with a per-novel word count of 65,000 words (65 k-words) or 520,000 words (520 k-words) per-series.

The **Series Design** is a very tactical approach based on influences by [Randy Ingermanson](http://www.amazon.com/Randy-Ingermanson/e/B001IXMD5S), [Evan Marshall](http://www.amazon.com/Evan-Marshall/e/B000APFQQI) and [Wallace Wang](http://www.amazon.com/Wallace-Wang/e/B000APXK5W/).

Concepts that build into this approach:

   * [Snowflake Method](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/), provided by Randy. I recommend reading this overview, then the related book in the bibliography where he demonstrates it. Really read through this, it has improved over the years. (Read also the [Randy Interview](http://storyfix.com/the-randy-ingermanson-interview))
   * Marshall Plan, provided by Evan
   * 8-Segment Story Structure, provided by Wallace.
   * Emotional Impact (because my readers have commented about difficulty engaging with characters), provided by Karl. This is more about making sure you focus on the Character portions of development. I am weak in this area.

The subsections:

* Viewpoint Characters - a simple reminder that you only have to focus on as few as a dozen characters to make a series.
* Creating the Series Plot - The first layer of the onion, a few pages to frame it all.
* Plotting the Novels - Expanding ever so slightly
* Novel / Series Characters - The biggest part is understanding your characters.
* Detailed Novel Plotting - How to really get the detail out of the entire series.
* Scene Plotting - When you're crazy enough to get very detailed.

**Book Writing** entails the long slog of writing as one steadily builds the novels. It leverages [Jame Rubin's](http://www.jamierubin.net/) experience in writing that results in a four-draft model.

The first series will take upward of seven years to fully write and publish. When intending to write subsequent series, those later series will take eight years to develop. However, you will be publishing works from two separate series simultaneously and drawing revenue from all. The more you write, the more you earn.

**Publishing the Series** Is all about how in 20 years one can write two or three series. You would earn on seven of those books, which when priced at $2.99 is $7.00 per series reader. The more you publish, the more you sell.

**Business Plan** is about remembering this is a business idea which entails thinking like a business.

## Investment

A question will be

## Series Design (3 Months)

**Up front:** Between 100 to 400 hours will be needed for Series Design, depending on the level of detail sought. If you assume 8 hours a weekend, then the 100 hours is about 12-weeks. So, this overall process would take between three months to a year.

The basis of this method is Snowflake, which provides an iterative approach to story-writing. Snowflake traditionally starts at the one-sentence novel summary (the high-concept), and when fully developed has paragraph summaries for the entire book. As it is iterative, we can use Snowflake to plot the entire series.

Snowflake is the [OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) of novel writing. As you write the series, you have to re-orient all other steps accordingly. By the time you get to the end of Snowflake, you will have your series down cold.

Randy describes the Snowflake Method as the creation of design documents. He recommends you use what you like and discard what you don't. His assessment is it would take 100 hours to follow his method for a novel. Based on that, it would take upwards of 800 hours to do the same for an entire novel series. That is likely a year of your time to produce solid design documents for an entire series.

A few terms I use to try to avoid confusion:

* Series Snowflake...represents the Snowflake steps relevant to the Series
* Novel Snowflake...relevant to the Novel
* I number each one "Series Snowflake-3" or "Novel Snowflake-2" to show the impact on the

### Viewpoint Characters 

Marshall Plan provides good advice for Viewpoint Characters. That is, a novel of 65 k-words will have three viewpoint characters (Hero, Opponent, Confidant) and four plotlines (Hero has an external and internal plotline. Wallace's book is very good at helping to think through how those plotlines develop, but the important part is that (usually) the hero's external circumstances lead to a change. When you get to Novel Snowflake-7, that will take a few days.

### Creating the Series Plot (8 Hours)

1. Give the series a working title. Until you have book titles, the working title can be used as a shorthand for each novel. For example, if the series is Patriots, then the novels would be Patriot-1, Patriot-4, etc.
2. Generate the one-sentence plotline of the entire series. (Series Snowflake-1)
2. Expand the plotline to an eight-sentence paragraph. (Series Snowflake-2, structured using the 8-Segment). It may help to follow Snowflake-2 as Randy recommends, then expand slightly to encompass the 8-Segment structure.
4. Take a moment to think of some of the series characters. Ideally you are looking at up-to-10 viewpoint characters. (Series Snowflake-3)
5. Remembering that each of these sentences is a novel, take the time to re-write the sentences as the plotline for each novel. The hard part is to make the sentences sound like they belong together while also allowing them to stand separately. (Novel Snowflake-1)

At this point, you have a basic series plot. Snowflake assumes each step takes an hour. The fifth step could then arguably take eight hours as you are following Snowflake-1 eight times. However, due to the thought already put in, that could probably take an hour.

If you assume five hours to a productive creator's day (a rule of thumb), then this is a one-day activity.

Let's see if the 8-Segment would work:

1. Series Setup.
2. Open the Door. Hero tries to return to the old world but cannot
3. Entering a New World. Learning the rules, minor victory
4. False Victory
5. Things go Downhill. Hero needs a new goal, another minor victory
6. Hero Hits Rock Bottom.
7. Hero Wins against minors
8. Final Victory

Imperial Postal Service:

1. Bellicose. Bophendze enters the world of a Postal Marine and only wants to survive
2. Litovio
3. Luctation. Jonaldy & Bophendze save Aren, Bophendze forced to see the limits of the IPS
4. Copa.
5. Imbroglio.
6. Scintilla. Discovers
7. Serendipity
8. Sc

### Plotting the Novels (8 Hours)

Once you have the Series Plot, take the time to develop the novels by following each Snowflake Step. The Series Plot gives you Snowflake-1 for all novels. By the end of this step, you will likely have invested a total of 13-15 hours in the entire series.

The next step is to take 8 hours to expand each Novel plot per Snowflake-2. Since you will have recurring characters, try to see how they intermix. You will still have an overall series hero and a series opponent...though it is entirely possible that the real hero/opponent are concepts. For example, a novel series could be a grand battle between liberty and oppression and the different viewpoint characters each representatives of the concept. The result of Novel Snowflake-2 is Series Snowflake-4.

### Novel & Series Characters (10-20 Hours)

Once you've completed Novel Snowflake-2, you likely have a four-page Series Summary (Series Snowflake-6). There are intermediary steps (series-related character, etc.) that have been overlooked. Take the time now to go back and develop the Series-relevant characters.

If you look at Snowflake, each character has a novel-specific goal and all that goal-seeking entails. Take the time to develop Novel-Snowflake-3 for each of the novels. Start by having one write-up for each of the viewpoint characters (Hero, Opponent, Confidant).

That will help you understand your viewpoint characters. Once the character synopses are done, develop Series Snowflake-3 (Series Character synopsis) that encompasses the novels. The result will be a character synopsis for development through the novels.

Repeat the process for Step 5 (Novel Snowflake-5, Series Snowflake-5) after you've finished the next bit.

When writing the storyline for the character, a helpful mental model is to think that each character thinks the story is about them. The Hero and Opposition both have the same goal, but only one can attain it and they are actively fighting one another. The Confidant's goal is to help the Hero attain his goal. Typically, the Opposition is successful until the end; and the likely failure is the inability to change.

This stage will take many hours, probably 10-20.

### Novel Plotting Leads to Thirty Page Series Outline (50-80 Hours)

Here's where I start mixing Snowflake with Marshall and 8-Segment. This could go wrong, so be patient...or toss what doesn't fit in your story. I am very probably creating a straight jacket that is unnecessary.

Snowflake-3 gives you each viewpoint character's storyline. Marshall provides a layout for intermingling. The hero gets most of the scenes (31). Opposition gets ten, and the Confidant gets nine.

The goal is to write one sentence that corresponds to each of the scenes below. The result is somewhere around Novel Snowflake-6 and Novel Snowflake-8.

When complete, you will have somewhere around four pages. If you do the same thing for every novel, then you will have a roughly 30-page Series outline.

This stage will take a week per novel...or two months.

### Scene Plotting (Varies)

This can be overkill, so proceed with confidence.

Novel Snowflake-9 is about expanding the scene sentences above into paragraphs. At its core, a scene has participants, setting, the conflict and the resolution. One may argue 2-5 paragraphs per page to describe each scene. Thus, a this step would produce 10-30 pages of solid narrative. The entire series could then be described in 80-240 pages. I would assume it would end up somewhere around 65 k-words itself, or the length of a novel. But, at this point, you have essentially rough-drafted every novel. Randy says this step is optional, but likely a good idea for a starting writer.

This stage will take a few months. If you include this step with all of the above, it will likely take a full year to develop the series to this level of detail. However, by this point you would have an amazing amount of detail.

## Drafting the Novel (6 Months)

Once you have finished the overall Series Outline, which comprises the outlines for the eight novels, you are ready to start drafting novels.

Until you know your writing pace, assume 500 words per hour, or about 120 hours to complete the Alpha draft (15 weeks at 8 hours/ week). Assume the second draft will take 1/2 that time. Thus, the first two drafts would run 180 hours, 23 weeks or six months.

The Third draft requires feedback, which takes time. During that time, you should start drafting the next novel. That gives them about three months, and gives you time to get the draft of another novel done. The Third Draft would take perhaps 30 hours to address, and another 30 hours for the final draft. A total of 240 hours per novel.

### First Real Draft (Alpha - Tell Yourself the Story)

The previous section really is the first draft, so this could just as easily be considered the second draft. Randy calls this the first *real* draft. How long it takes to write this is based on your pace. I've managed to write about 600 words per hour. From that optic, a rough draft of 65 k-words is about 110 hours.

The purpose of the first draft is to tell yourself the story. You have done most of that in the Design above. But as Randy says, about 1/2 of the way through you will have to go back and revise your documents. I recommend doing it once per Act.

Your writing will be sloppy. You'll be telling, not showing in places. Fine. When you have to fake something (character name), put "TK" (very few English words have the letters TK) so you can find it later. Such as, "TK-CHARACTER."

Keep a TODO list. When you name a character,  you will need to take tie to develop the character (Novel Snowflake-3) to ensure the character isn't cardboard.

### Second Draft (Beta - Tell Your Audience Your Story)

The purpose of the second draft is to tell your audience. Go back through and fix the narrative. Some suggest this should be a full draft. The point is, do not be emotionally attached to what you wrote in the first draft. Where you are emotionally attached, there you will fail.

### Third Draft (Incorporate First Reader Feedback)

After the second draft is complete, send it to some trusted readers and ask for their feedback. When you have that feedback, go back through and incorporate that feedback.

### Final Draft (Omit Needless Words)

Now go back through the book and omit needless words. The purpose here is to be lean in your story telling.

## Publishing the Series (Seven Years)

Do not publish any of the novels until you've finished the fourth of the series. Apart from the encouraging feedback from your Beta readers, you will have nothing to feed off of for about 30 months. (I broke this rule.)

At that point, I recommend taking time to develop a second series. Any subsequent series should have two books ready for publish before released. Thus, after writing the fourth book of the first series, write two of the next. That is:

* Series 1, Book 5
* Series 2, Book 1
* Series 1, Book 6
* Series 2, Book 2
 
You start selling the second series after the second book is ready for publish. By that point, you will only have a few books left of your first series---it will be time to transition your readers. Five to Six years will have passed from when you started.

Before you begin to publish the first series, you will have time to go back and perhaps do additional revisions of the earlier novels based on your improved writing and better understanding of the story after you've written the fourth.

### ISBNs

Go to [Bowker](http://www.bowker.com/) and pay the money for ISBNs, buy a 10-block as they are cheaper. Use those for the print version and tie them with your Kindle version. Most of the sales will be Kindle, the print copy (courtesy of [Createspace](http://createspace.com)) is a essentially marketing tool.

### Cover Design

Go to [99Designs](http://99designs.com) and find a good cover artist. You are looking for an artist who is serious and someone you will want to work with for the seven years it will take to publish the series. Expect to pay $2K to get four good covers (though I was closer to $1K). Have all covers made quickly, while you're revising the fourth. Be careful that the cover designer does not use obvious clip art or copyrighted images. (I had somebody try to sell a cover using Halo's Master Chief. Let me know if you want a good recommendation.)

## Business Plan

You don't make any business investment (time or money) without a coherent business plan. The sections below are from a model template I use.

* Mission statement is what you want to sell to whom and why,
* Product Description is a one-paragraph summary of each novel series, and the target audience,
* Strategy is what I described above...how you intend on getting published,
* Marketing and Sales is simple: Sell on Kindle and Createspace and follow [Randy's passive marketing model](http://bit.ly/1Oe5gff),
* Management is more about your beta readers and trusted advisors, 
* Financial Plans...how are you going to pay for it?


### Summary

3. Develop a mission statement. All businesses have one, and so should you. In other words, pinpoint what you are trying to achieve—and why. After all, it's not enough to bring a product to market; it also has to serve a purpose.

* **Goals.** It helps to have an idea of what you're trying to accomplish. For example, for every $1K of earnings per month, you need 1,000 sales per month.

### Product Description

Understand your market and what you intend to provide. This is easy: produce a series of novel series. You will want to provide the theme, target audience and one-paragraph series summary for every series.

1. Identify your product. What do you intend to produce? A book, article, series of promotional pamphlets? A service by which you enrich, encourage, inform others through the written word? Be as specific in your description as you can. And while you're at it, give your product-to-be a working title.

2. Identify your customers. Who exactly are they? Men, women, children? Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs? Baby boomers, working women, recovering alcoholics? Where and how do they live? How old are they? What's their educational or financial level? Where do they stand politically, spiritually? What do they most need and want in their lives—and how can you, through your written product, deliver it?

### Strategy

7. Know how much time you'll need---and where to find it. All businesses take time to establish. Writing businesses are no exception. What is the minimum amount of time your project requires on a daily or weekly basis to keep it going? Multiply this out over the course of several weeks, months, or, if need be, years. Brainstorm ways to match and create additional pockets of time to keep your venture on track.

### Marketing and Sales

This section should:

* Identify and describe your market – who your customers are and what the demand is for your products & services.
* Describe your channels of distribution.
* Explain your sales strategy, specific to pricing, promotion, products and place (4Ps).

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* Basic information about the industry you operate in and the customer needs you are fulfilling.
* The scope and share of your business market, as well as who your target customers are.

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* Who your market is and how you will reach it.
* How your company will apply pricing, promotion, product diversification and channel distribution to sell your products and services competitively.

### Management

8. Create a board of advisors. All businesses need a core group of advisors (attorneys, CPAs, and the like) if they are to grow and prosper - and so do you. Your core group will have a different make-up, obviously; still, these are the folks you'll turn to for advice and encouragement. They don't all have to be writers, by the way. They should, however, support you in personal and professional ways, and hold you to a higher standard.

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* The legal form of ownership for your business.
* Who the leaders are in your business as well as their roles.
* The general flow of operations within the firm.

### Financial Plan

6. Determine how much money you will need. Every writing project requires some kind of expenditure, be it for file folders, travel, time off from work, etc. List your expenses and realistically ask yourself if you can afford to undertake your venture. If not, determine what you can do to cut a few corners, create a reserve, or "beg, borrow, or steal."

4. Identify what you have in start-up capital. What do you bring to the table as you launch your venture? Some items will be tangible (e.g., a computer, work space, financial reserve). Others will be intangible but critical nonetheless (e.g., key skills, and personal and professional experiences, etc.).

5. Identify what you do not yet have. Now that you know what start-up capital you have on hand, take a moment to pinpoint what you still need. Again, these things can be tangible or intangible. For example, you might need a workable writing space, a solid enough knowledge of your subject area, a ghostwriter, etc. Next, brainstorm ways to obtain each item you have listed.
