Do not publish any of the novels until you've finished the fourth of the series. Apart from the encouraging feedback from your Beta readers, you will have nothing to feed off of for about 30 months. (I broke this rule.)

At that point, I recommend taking time to develop a second series. Any subsequent series should have two books ready for publish before released. Thus, after writing the fourth book of the first series, write two of the next. That is:

* Series 1, Book 5
* Series 2, Book 1
* Series 1, Book 6
* Series 2, Book 2
 
You start selling the second series after the second book is ready for publish. By that point, you will only have a few books left of your first series---it will be time to transition your readers. Five to Six years will have passed from when you started.

Before you begin to publish the first series, you will have time to go back and perhaps do additional revisions of the earlier novels based on your improved writing and better understanding of the story after you've written the fourth.

## ISBNs

Go to [Bowker](http://www.bowker.com/) and pay the money for ISBNs, buy a 10-block as they are cheaper. Use those for the print version and tie them with your Kindle version. Most of the sales will be Kindle, the print copy (courtesy of [Createspace](http://createspace.com)) is a essentially marketing tool.

## Cover Design

Go to [99Designs](http://99designs.com) and find a good cover artist. You are looking for an artist who is serious and someone you will want to work with for the seven years it will take to publish the series. Expect to pay $2K to get four good covers (though I was closer to $1K). Have all covers made quickly, while you're revising the fourth. Be careful that the cover designer does not use obvious clip art or copyrighted images. (I had somebody try to sell a cover using Halo's Master Chief. Let me know if you want a good recommendation.)
