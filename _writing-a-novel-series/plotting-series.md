1. Give the series a working title. Until you have book titles, the working title can be used as a shorthand for each novel. For example, if the series is Patriots, then the novels would be Patriot-1, Patriot-4, etc.
2. Generate the one-sentence plotline of the entire series. (Series Snowflake-1)
2. Expand the plotline to an eight-sentence paragraph. (Series Snowflake-2, structured using the 8-Segment). It may help to follow Snowflake-2 as Randy recommends, then expand slightly to encompass the 8-Segment structure.
4. Take a moment to think of some of the series characters. Ideally you are looking at up-to-10 viewpoint characters. (Series Snowflake-3)
5. Remembering that each of these sentences is a novel, take the time to re-write the sentences as the plotline for each novel. The hard part is to make the sentences sound like they belong together while also allowing them to stand separately. (Novel Snowflake-1)

At this point, you have a basic series plot. Snowflake assumes each step takes an hour. The fifth step could then arguably take eight hours as you are following Snowflake-1 eight times. However, due to the thought already put in, that could probably take an hour.

If you assume five hours to a productive creator's day (a rule of thumb), then this is a one-day activity.

Let's see if the 8-Segment would work:

1. Series Setup.
2. Open the Door. Hero tries to return to the old world but cannot
3. Entering a New World. Learning the rules, minor victory
4. False Victory
5. Things go Downhill. Hero needs a new goal, another minor victory
6. Hero Hits Rock Bottom.
7. Hero Wins against minors
8. Final Victory

Imperial Postal Service:

1. Bellicose. Bophendze enters the world of a Postal Marine and only wants to survive
2. Litovio
3. Luctation. Jonaldy & Bophendze save Aren, Bophendze forced to see the limits of the IPS
4. Copa.
5. Imbroglio.
6. Scintilla. Discovers
7. Serendipity
8. Sc
