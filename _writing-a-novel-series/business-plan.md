You don't make any business investment (time or money) without a coherent business plan. The sections below are from a model template I use.

* **Mission statement** is what you want to sell to whom and why,
* **Product Description** is a one-paragraph summary of each novel series, and the target audience,
* **Strategy** is what I described above...how you intend on getting published,
* **Marketing and Sales** is simple: Sell on Kindle and Createspace and follow [Randy's passive marketing model](http://bit.ly/1Oe5gff),
* **Management** is more about your beta readers and trusted advisors, 
* **Financial Plans**...how are you going to pay for it?


## Summary

3. Develop a mission statement. All businesses have one, and so should you. In other words, pinpoint what you are trying to achieve—and why. After all, it's not enough to bring a product to market; it also has to serve a purpose.

* **Goals.** It helps to have an idea of what you're trying to accomplish. For example, for every $1K of earnings per month, you need 1,000 sales per month.

## Product Description

Understand your market and what you intend to provide. This is easy: produce a series of novel series. You will want to provide the theme, target audience and one-paragraph series summary for every series.

1. Identify your product. What do you intend to produce? A book, article, series of promotional pamphlets? A service by which you enrich, encourage, inform others through the written word? Be as specific in your description as you can. And while you're at it, give your product-to-be a working title.

2. Identify your customers. Who exactly are they? Men, women, children? Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs? Baby boomers, working women, recovering alcoholics? Where and how do they live? How old are they? What's their educational or financial level? Where do they stand politically, spiritually? What do they most need and want in their lives—and how can you, through your written product, deliver it?

## Strategy

7. Know how much time you'll need---and where to find it. All businesses take time to establish. Writing businesses are no exception. What is the minimum amount of time your project requires on a daily or weekly basis to keep it going? Multiply this out over the course of several weeks, months, or, if need be, years. Brainstorm ways to match and create additional pockets of time to keep your venture on track.

## Marketing and Sales

This section should:

* Identify and describe your market – who your customers are and what the demand is for your products & services.
* Describe your channels of distribution.
* Explain your sales strategy, specific to pricing, promotion, products and place (4Ps).

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* Basic information about the industry you operate in and the customer needs you are fulfilling.
* The scope and share of your business market, as well as who your target customers are.

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* Who your market is and how you will reach it.
* How your company will apply pricing, promotion, product diversification and channel distribution to sell your products and services competitively.

## Management

8. Create a board of advisors. All businesses need a core group of advisors (attorneys, CPAs, and the like) if they are to grow and prosper - and so do you. Your core group will have a different make-up, obviously; still, these are the folks you'll turn to for advice and encouragement. They don't all have to be writers, by the way. They should, however, support you in personal and professional ways, and hold you to a higher standard.

After reviewing this section the reader should know:

* The legal form of ownership for your business.
* Who the leaders are in your business as well as their roles.
* The general flow of operations within the firm.

## Financial Plan

6. Determine how much money you will need. Every writing project requires some kind of expenditure, be it for file folders, travel, time off from work, etc. List your expenses and realistically ask yourself if you can afford to undertake your venture. If not, determine what you can do to cut a few corners, create a reserve, or "beg, borrow, or steal."

4. Identify what you have in start-up capital. What do you bring to the table as you launch your venture? Some items will be tangible (e.g., a computer, work space, financial reserve). Others will be intangible but critical nonetheless (e.g., key skills, and personal and professional experiences, etc.).

5. Identify what you do not yet have. Now that you know what start-up capital you have on hand, take a moment to pinpoint what you still need. Again, these things can be tangible or intangible. For example, you might need a workable writing space, a solid enough knowledge of your subject area, a ghostwriter, etc. Next, brainstorm ways to obtain each item you have listed.
