These are my notes regarding the book *Moral Premise*, by Stan Williams. The story of a novel is the inner conflict between two conflicting values, such as:

* Self-respect v. self-destruction
* Independence v. Dependence

## Moral Premise Forms

### General Form of the Moral Premise
        
(In Comedy)

> Vice leads to undesirable consequences; but Virtue leads to desirable consequences.

(In Tragedy)

> [Virtue] leads to [success], and [Vice] leads to [defeat], but [Unrelenting vice] leads to [destruction].

(No Redemptive Arc)

> Although the Bond character may not journey through a redemptive arc, the movies still communicate a clear theme that could be stated this way: **The pursuit of power leads to death and defeat; while The pursuit of justice leads to life and success.**


### Formal Structure of a Moral Premise

* [Vice] leads to [defeat], but [Virtue] leads to [success].

> A Moral Premise is the practical lesson of a story. What I really want to point out, however, is that the term moral does not literally refer to just what is right, but rather to the discourse of the distinction between what is right and wrong. That means any juxtaposition between what is perceived as right and what is perceived as wrong is moral in nature. And that most such juxtapositions lead us naturally to conflict — the element without which storytelling cannot exist. (pp. 19-20)

> [D]evelop the protagonist’s outer motivation in the first draft of the story outline and treatment. Then you can make the Moral Premise connection (or theme connection) during the second and third draft of the treatment. ... [M]uch of the main character’s motivation hinges on the Moral Premise that to wait even until after a first draft of the script will require considerable and unnecessary rework. (p.38)

## Law of Moral Premise

In essence, that is what this book is attempting to do — to explain one of the natural laws of storytelling — the natural law of the Moral Premise. With that, let me introduce the form of the Moral Premise, its natural law, and three corollaries. When applied together they give a work the best possible foundation for box office success.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope='row'>Corollary A</th>
        <td>A story’s inconsistent application of a true Moral Premise will lead to a work’s demise.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope='row'>Corollary B</th>
        <td>Any application of a false Moral Premise will lead to a work’s demise.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope='row'>Corollary C</th>
        <td>The target audience determines the truth of the Moral Premise.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Comedy v. tragedy. In comedy, the hero uses the Moment of Grace to accept the truth of the Moral Premise. In tragedy, the hero refuses the truth presented in the Moment of Grace.

### Identification Pattern

1. Audience recognizes that natural law contains a system of moral absolutes
2. Moral choices have a consequence consistent with natural law.
3. Suffering, which is a consequence of natural law, can lead to purpose and hope.

## Format for stating the Moral Premise

The Moral Premise comprises four parts: a virtue, a vice, desirable consequences (success), and undesirable consequences (defeat). These four parts can be used to create a statement that describes precisely what a movie is really about, on both physical and psychological levels. The Theme is the shorthand description of the Moral Premise.

This is the formal structure of a Moral Premise:

> "[Vice] leads to [defeat], but [Virtue] leads to [success]." (p. 61)

## Steps for Generating Moral Premise

**Step 1. Determine the Controlling Virtue.** A controlling virtue is something that I as a writer hold in great esteem. It must also be a virtue commonly held by the readership.

**Step 2. Determine the Controlling Vice.** Use the table below (or other) to find the polar opposite vice to your chosen virtue.

Once you select the motivating vices and opposing virtues, you are ready to give your characters depth. That means, of course, assigning vices to your hero, and virtues to your villain. Yes, I wrote that correctly...*vices* to your hero and *virtues* to your villain.

**Step 3. Determine the Moral Premise.** Use whichever format helps you best:

> [Vice] leads to [undesirable consequences], but [Virtue] leads to [desirable consequences];

or

>    [Vice] leads to [defeat]; but [virtue] leads to [success].

The Moral Premise statement must be a natural law, an absolute truth. It must be true for any person, anywhere, throughout time. Thus, it must be general. Your story is very specific , but this truth, upon which your story is based, is the identifying element for your audience of millions.

**Step 4. Determine the Work's Genre.**

**Step 5. Determine the Protagonist's Physical Goal.**

**Step 6. Determine the Protagonist's Physical Obstacles.**

**Step 7. Determine the Major Dramatic Beats.** The goal of this step is to create Arc Tables for your main characters. Create one table, per page, for each main character. At the top of every table for each character write out the same Moral Premise statement---your guide for completing the rest of the table. (p.135)

* Column A, List each goal relevant to the story
* Column B, Identify the generalized vice practiced
* Column C, Event or moment that offers the character a clear choice to change
* Column D, Character's virtuous trait that leads the character toward success.

**Step 8. Sequence the Dramatic Beats.**  If you have completed the Arc Plots for seven characters, and each character has three goals (one major, and two minor), you will have described no less than 63 major dramatic beats. 103 That will probably be too much to cram into a 90-minute or even two-hour movie. You might want to consider giving your "lesser" main characters only one goal at first. (p. 137)
