## Overview


All authors have delusions. We believe our writing is better or worse than it is. Many of us aspire to high art, while others just don't care. I'd like to think my writing is decent, though I will readily admit I'm a poor writer of bad Science-Fiction. This page lists various standards that I'd like to think my writing could aspire to.

## Hays Code

The general purpose of the *[Hays Code](/hays-code/)* was to ensure that cinema would not debase the moral standards of its audience. The sympathy of the audience should never side with crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin. Correct standards of life and lawful behavior should be lauded. Wrong behavior and lawlessness should have consequences.

## Dove Content Standards

These are the S,L,V,D,N,O ratings from [The Dove Foundation](http://www.dove.org/). If any category has less than 3, it is **Approved**. A **Family-Approved Seal** is given when all categories are under 3. If all categories are 0 or 1, then it is considered suitable for all ages.

The Dove Foundation has **Faith-Friendly Seals**. Movies with this seal are judged according to the same criteria as Family-Approved, except the Christian faith is depicted somewhere in the storyline. A **Faith-Based** seal may be provided to a movie that is considered objectionable except there is a strong Christian theme of redemption.
