<h2 id="about-daushanet">About Dausha.net</h2>

<p>Welcome to my site. This has been my personal site since November 1998. I used to use dausha.com, but lost control of it in 1998 and had to wait until 2002. “Dausha” is Egyptian for noise pollution, and was a nickname I picked up in school about a quarter-century ago…even though I’m WASP.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h3>

<blockquote>
  My life is about telling stories.
  <small>Ben Wilson</small>
</blockquote>

<p>When friends and co-workers find that I write novels, I explain that I am a poor writer of bad Science Fiction. I don’t pretend to write the Great (Insert Nationality Here) Novel, or even the most provocative. I just write and try to improve.</p>

<p>I’ve had the yen for storytelling my whole life. It started listening to my dad tell funny stories when I was a boy. I picked up his talent for oral story telling. My first career was in the military, which is a story-telling culture, where I honed my talent. I’ve yearned to write for thirty years and began to more seriously apply myself in recent years. It’s not the easiest process in the world, but I enjoy putting the words to screen. I hope you enjoy what you read. If you’d like to share with me ways you think the story could be improved, I’d love to have you in my community.</p>

<p>The <strong>Postal Marine Series</strong> follows the careers of two Imperial Postal Marines, Bophendze and Litovio.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> provides the Platform as a Service (PaaS), which lets one host for free if the traffic’s not too heavy. Hey, if <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> can be the largest consumer of public cloud infrastructure, I can use Github.</p>

<p>The style was designed by Ben Wilson, using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter’s Bootstrap</a> as its foundation, rendered in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Non-standard web fonts are provided courtesy of <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google</a>. The theme’s coloring was determined by varying off of <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> to soften the rough edges.</p>

<p>Site content is authored on my local computer using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Jekyll lets me use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> in all its glory. Having previously used <a href="http://pmwiki.org/">PmWiki</a> for web sites, being able to use pure Markdown is just plain fun. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> provides the transport mechanism to deliver the code to the web server.</p>

<p>Have I established my geek creds?</p>
