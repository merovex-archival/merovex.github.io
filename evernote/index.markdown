## Send an email into Evernote

To send an email into Evernote, open an email and click Forward. For the recipient, enter your Evernote email address.

The Subject line will become the title of the new note.

You can add special characters at the end of your subject line to control the destination notebook, add tags, or set a Reminder.

 **@Notebook**: Notes will go into your default notebook unless you specify one using the at (@) symbol and notebook name, such as @travel. You do not need quotes if you have a space in the notebook title. For example, you would write @International Travel or @My Notebook.

 **#Tag**: Add tags using the pound or hashtag (#) symbol, such as #manchester #england

 **!Reminder**: Use the exclamation point (!) to set a Reminder. To add an alarm to the Reminder, add the word tomorrow, or a date with numeric year, month, day separated by slashes. For example: !, !tomorrow, !2013/06/24

Send your email and you'll see it appear as a note inside Evernote. 

The standard is:

	Email Subject: [Title of note] ![optional date for Reminder] @[folder] #[tag]
