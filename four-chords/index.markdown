C
My life is brilliant
G
My love is pure
Am
I saw an angel
F
Of that I'm sure
C                       G
People killing people dying
                                Am
Children hurtin you hear them crying
                            F
Can you practice what you preach
Would you turn the other cheek?
C         G
Forever young
Am                      F
I want to be forever young
C                          G
I won't hesitate no more, no more
Am
It cannot wait
F
I'm Yours
C                    G
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
Am                F
I knew I wouldn't forget you
C           G
If I could, then I would
Am            F
I'll go wherever you will go
C       G        Am       F
And can you feel the love tonight
C                  G
Nobody wanna see us together
Am      F
But it don't matter no

(The Rest follows this pattern)

C
'Cause I got you

G
Country roads, take me home
To the place
I belong

C
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi

F
I can't live
With or without you

G
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see

F
And she will be loved
She will be loved

G
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me

F
No, woman, no cry
Yeah, Mama this surely is a dream
I come from a land down under

Am
Red, white and blue all the funny things you do
America, America, This is you

C
They say Taylor was a good girl
never one to be late
complain express ideas in her brain

F
I need some love like
I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby

Am
Take on me
When I come around
Take me on
When I come around
I'll be gone
When I'm on take
C    G
Save tonight
Am                  F
Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
and fight the break of dawn come tomorrow
Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Tomorrow I'll be gone

F
If I were a boy
Here I am, once again
I think I could understand
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one

G
In my head
I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head
Am          F    C     G
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Am   F     G       C
What if God was one of us
Am                                        F
Tell me: Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
C
I see the way you're
G
Actin like you're somebody
Am  F      C             G   Am         F       C           G
I Know she's playin with me, but thats ok coz I got no self esteem
Am     F                C     G              Am          F            C
With a 1,000 eyes and a great disguise I'll look em right between the eyes
         G
hit them right between the eyes

Am
'cause You're so beautiful
F
So damn beautiful

C
It's too late to apologize
G
It's too late

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Come on Barbie, let's go party!

How long how long will I slide
Separate my

Double rainbow all the way 'cross the sky
Yeah, Yeah, so intense

Control yourself
Take only what you need from him
A family of trees wanting

Time to say goodbye
Veduto e vissuto con te
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind?

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
I'm a birdplane, I'm a birdplane
A mother fuckin' birdplane

And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver?
The way things could have gone.
And doesn't it feel peculiar,
When everyone wants a little more?
So that I do remember to never go this far
That's all it takes to be a STAR!!
